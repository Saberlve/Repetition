These natural products may be dimerized during their biosynthesis, which proceeds through atom- and energy-sufficient methods involving dimeric enzymes, to provide complex structures from simple compounds. Coumarin-derived dimers features the C-C or C-O-C biaryl, terpene sidechain linkages or by cyclobutane ring and acts as inhibitors of α-glucosidase, and cytochrome p450 while some show anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities, while chalcone-derived dimers have the 1,3-dihydroxy phenyl (resorcinol) substitution on the periphery of cyclobutane or cyclohexane ring and inhibit topoisomerase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and cathepsins and others possess anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-plasmodial activities. Resveratrol-derived dimers have the resorcinol structure and are formed by oxidative coupling showing antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-HIV, anti-tyrosinase, and cytotoxic activity. Bioavailability evidence of closely related structural monomers could be applicable to their dimeric forms. Application of bioisosteric principles to such dimeric compounds is also discussed. Overall, these dimeric natural products can provide potent templates for the natural product-based drug discovery against several diseases."

The microextraction device employs 4 mg of C18 silica sorbent inserted into a microvolume syringe for sample preparation. Several parameters capable of influencing the microextraction procedure, namely, number of extraction cycles, washing solvent, volume of washing solvent, elution solvent, volume of eluting solvent and pH of matrix, were optimized. The developed method produced satisfactory results with excellent values of coefficient of determination (R2 > 0.9804) within the established calibration range. The extraction yields were satisfactory for all analytes (> 89.32%) for aqueous samples and (> 87.45%) for fluidic biological samples. The limits of detection values lie in the range 14-828 pg/mL."

Ford has said the move will help council make decisions and deliver services \"more efficiently and effectively\" and save taxpayers $25 million over four years.\n\nThe legislation also cancels planned elections for the head of council position in the regional municipalities of Muskoka, Peel, York and Niagara. Instead, the head of council in each region will be appointed.\n\nFord stressed that his time as a former Toronto councillor gave him insight into the problems of the city's government, noting that its challenges are unlike those of others in Ontario.\n\n\"I would say that many of Toronto's issues are specific to Toronto,\" he said.\n\nThe city's legal team has filed a confidential report with advice on a potential court challenge on the issue, and the document is expected to be debated behind closed doors Monday.\n\nToronto Mayor John Tory said the timing of the provincial legislation — coming before the Oct. 22 municipal election — has put the city in an unprecedented situation.\n\n\"The process by which this monumental change was made was wrong and unacceptable,\" he said.\n\n\"It is our duty to represent the people of Toronto and the best interests of this city at all times — and to make our position clear when we do not believe the actions of other levels of government are in our city's best interest.\"\n\nChris Young/CPOntario Premier Doug Ford and Toronto Mayor John Tory take part in a candlelit vigil to honour the victims of a deadly shooting in Toronto on July 25, 2018.\n\nFord, who lost the 2014 Toronto mayoral race to Tory, stunned local politicians and residents last month when he announced the council-cutting plan, which was not part of his election platform.\n\nThe premier has said Toronto's council can debate a potential legal challenge if it wishes but noted that his government had already moved on the issue.\n\n\"They can talk about Bill 5 all they want,\" he said Friday. \"At the end of the day, we made a decision to make government run more efficiently here in the city of Toronto.\""

        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nExcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a recurrent uncontrollable compulsion to sleep when intending to stay awake.[@B1][@B2] Sleepiness lowers the ability of an individual to perform various daytime functions, and is a risk factor for traffic accidents and occupational injuries.[@B3][@B4][@B5] Sleepiness also has negative effects on general health, social engagement, and quality of life,[@B6][@B7][@B8] and has been associated with cardiovascular disease and metabolic abnormality.[@B9][@B10][@B11][@B12][@B13][@B14] These findings have led to daytime sleepiness receiving increasing attention as an important public health issue.[@B15]\n\nThe prevalence of EDS has ranged widely in many studies worldwide, from 2.5% to 26%.[@B2][@B9][@B12][@B13][@B15][@B16][@B17][@B18][@B19][@B20][@B21][@B22][@B23][@B24][@B25][@B26][@B27] This high variability is mainly due to the use of different tools to measure sleepiness and the different definitions of EDS. In population-based studies using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), which is a well-validated survey instrument used to quantify daytime sleepiness, the prevalence of EDS is estimated to range between 9% and 26%.\n\nSeveral studies performed in Western countries have determined the prevalence of EDS, but there have been few reports on the nationwide prevalence of EDS in Korea. Most previous epidemiologic studies have investigated the possible determinants of EDS in relation to sleep duration or insufficient sleep separately. Since the sleep need differs between individuals, the same duration of sleep will lead to sleep insufficiency in some individuals but not others.[@B28] For example, self-reported short sleepers may include individuals with no sleep insufficiency and others with sleep insufficiency who purposefully curtail their sleep even if they need more sleep. This makes it necessary to differentiate the effects of short sleep duration and unmet sleep need on EDS. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of both sleep duration and unmet sleep need on EDS.\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of EDS in Korean adults and identify the separate and combined associations of both habitual sleep duration and unmet sleep need with EDS.\n\nMETHODS\n=======\n\nStudy population and survey method\n----------------------------------\n\nThe participants in this study comprised adults aged 19 years and older who resided in South Korea. Detailed information regarding the study population and survey method is available elsewhere.[@B29] Briefly, the survey was conducted by Gallup Korea in 2010 using multistage clustered sampling and involved participants from 15 administrative districts (metropolitan and provincial areas); all administrative districts except Jeju Island (a province) were included. All administrative divisions were further divided into si, gun, or gu, which are the basic units of administrative districts in South Korea. Using the proportionate quota sampling method according to the population distributions of sex and age, Gallup Korea approached 7,615 individuals, of which 2,836 subjects completed this survey. Seventy-six trained interviewers conducted the face-to-face interviews. All of the respondents provided informed consent before the survey. We excluded 67 participants with missing questionnaire responses on smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, education level, body mass index (BMI), occupation, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), ESS score, and sleep habits; data from 2,769 participants were therefore used in the analyses. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital.\n\nMeasurement of excessive daytime sleepiness\n-------------------------------------------\n\nDaytime sleepiness was assessed using the ESS, which is a well-validated questionnaire consisting of eight items that quantify the likelihood of dozing in eight different situations.[@B1] The total ESS score ranges from 0 to 24, and daytime sleepiness was considered excessive in this study if the score was \\>10.\n\nSleep questionnaire\n-------------------\n\nThe main independent variables for this study were habitual sleep duration and unmet sleep need. The weekday and weekend average sleep durations of the participants over the previous month were recorded from their answers to a specific question in the questionnaire. Habitual sleep duration was defined as \\[(weekday sleep duration×5)+(weekend sleep duration×2)\\]/7. For sleep need, participants were asked \\\"How much sleep do you need to be at your best during the day?\\\" Unmet sleep need was calculated as the sleep need minus the habitual sleep duration. We used the ISI to measure the intensity of insomnia. The ISI is a brief self-report instrument consisting of seven items rated on a numeric scale from 0 to 4. Scores on the ISI may range from 0 to 28, and insomnia severity was classified as follows: 0--7, no clinically significant insomnia; 8--14, subthreshold insomnia; and 15--28, clinical insomnia.[@B30]\n\nOther measures\n--------------\n\nInformation on age, sex, height, weight, education level, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, occupation, and snoring was self-reported. BMI was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters.\n\nStatistical analysis\n--------------------\n\nAll of the statistical analyses were performed using STATA (version 11.0, StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA). Unadjusted differences in continuous and categorical variables between the EDS and non-EDS groups were assessed for significance using the *t*-test or the χ^2^ test, as appropriate. We used logistic regression analyses to examine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDS scores associated with habitual sleep duration and unmet sleep need, separately and then together; this also included adjustment for relevant covariates. The statistical models were progressively adjusted. The covariates included in the model were age (continuous), sex, BMI (\\<18.5, 18.5--25, or ≥25 kg/m^2^), smoking (yes or no), alcohol consumption (yes or no), physical activity (none, 1 or 2, or ≥3 times/week), education level (lower than high school, high school, or higher than high school), and ISI (normal, subthreshold insomnia, or clinical insomnia), and snoring (none, 1--3, or ≥4 days/week). A probability level of *p*\\<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\n=======\n\nThe sociodemographic and sleep-related characteristics in the participants with and without EDS are compared in [Table 1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}. The overall prevalence of EDS in the study population was 11.9% (95% CI, 10.7--13.2). Participants with EDS were older, more likely to have less than a high-school education, and had a higher BMI than those without EDS. The distributions of sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity did not differ between those with and without EDS. In terms of sleep-related factors, participants with EDS had shorter sleep durations and a longer unmet sleep need compared with those without EDS. The prevalence of insomnia and frequent snoring was higher among participants with EDS than among those without EDS.\n\nThe prevalence rates of EDS according to sociodemographic and sleep-related characteristics are presented in [Table 2](#T2){ref-type=\"table\"}. Of all the subjects, 883 (31.9%) reported not getting at least 7 hours of sleep. An unmet sleep need of \\>0 hours was present in 835 (30.2%) of the participants. The prevalence of EDS increased with age, and was significantly higher in those aged 60--69 years (15.5%) than in those aged 19--29 years (9.7%). The prevalence rates of EDS were 15.9% and 16.3% in the underweight and overweight groups, respectively, and these were both significantly higher than that in the normal-weight group (10.2%). The prevalence of EDS among those with less than a high-school education was 15.2%, which was significantly higher than those in the groups with a high-school and a higher level of education. The prevalence of EDS was 33.6% in the clinical insomnia group and 22.4% in the subclinical insomnia group; these were significantly higher than that in the normal group (9.1%). The prevalence of EDS was 18.1% in habitual snorers (snoring ≥4 days/week), which was significantly higher than in those who did not snore (10.6%). The prevalence of EDS was 15.8% in the group with sleep durations of \\<6 hours and 14.4% in the group with sleep durations of 6 to 7 hours, which was significantly higher than that in the group with sleep durations of ≥8 hours (9.4%). The prevalence of EDS was 19.6% in the group with an unmet sleep need of ≥2 hours, and 15.4% in the group with an unmet sleep need of 0.01 to 2 hours; these were significantly higher than that in the group with a sufficient sleep duration (9.5%).\n\nLogistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations of sleep duration and unmet sleep need with EDS, separately and then together, while adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and education level. Additionally, we progressively adjusted for insomnia and snoring ([Table 3](#T3){ref-type=\"table\"}). The adjusted OR for EDS was significantly higher in subjects with a sleep duration of \\<6 hours a night (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.21--2.64) and subjects with a sleep duration of 6 to 7 hours a night (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.17--2.23) than in those with a sleep duration of ≥8 hours a night. The adjusted OR for EDS was significantly higher in subjects with an unmet sleep need of ≥2 hours (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.80--3.23) and subjects with an unmet sleep need of 0.01 to 2 hours (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.37--2.55) than in those with no unmet sleep need. The combination effect of sleep duration and unmet sleep need was then evaluated, which resulted in the association between sleep duration and EDS no longer being statistically significant. In contrast, there was a significantly higher risk of EDS in the groups with unmet sleep needs of ≥2 hours (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.66--3.23) and 0.01 to 2 hours (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.30--2.47). This trend persisted after also adjusting for insomnia and snoring, although the ORs for EDS were reduced to 1.80 (95% CI, 1.27--2.54) and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.02--1.98), respectively.\n\nDISCUSSION\n==========\n\nThis study investigated the prevalence of EDS (defined as an ESS score of \\>10) according to sociodemographic factors, and evaluated the association between sleep duration and/or unmet sleep need and EDS in a population of Korean adults. We found that the prevalence of EDS was 11.9% among both male and female Korean adults. Several studies have estimated the prevalence of EDS using the ESS in general populations. Studies involving Australian adults found that the prevalence of EDS ranged from 11.7% to 15.3%.[@B2][@B12][@B25] In French adults, 12.0% of men and 6.0% of women reportedly had EDS.[@B24] A previous Korean study using data from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study found that the prevalence of EDS was 12.2%.[@B26] Another study found that the prevalence of EDS in Norwegian adults was 17.7%.[@B23] In the Sleep Heart Health Study, 29.7% of men and 20.8% of women had an ESS score of \\>10.[@B20] In the MONICA Study, 26.1% of a Polish population suffered from EDS.[@B18] The overall prevalence of EDS in the present study is similar to those found in Australia, New Zealand, and France, but lower than those in the US and Poland. These differences between studies may be caused by various factors, including differences in study methodologies and in the sociocultural and other characteristics of the included populations.\n\nWe found that the prevalence of EDS did not differ between the sexes. Although sex-based differences have been found in community-based studies,[@B20][@B31] several populationbased studies produced conflicting findings.[@B13][@B32] This inconsistency may be due to differences in sampling methods leading to different sex ratios in the populations included in the different studies, or in the questionnaires used to measure daytime sleepiness, since men and women can interpret questions differently. Unadjusted analysis showed that the factors associated with EDS in the present study were older age, higher BMI, lower level of education, frequent snoring, and insomnia. Older people (aged 60--69 years) had a higher prevalence of EDS compared with younger people (aged 19--29 years) in our study, which may be attributed to the presence of underlying medical or sleep disorders and the different lifestyle of the elderly. Many older adults are not able to get sufficient sleep for various reasons, including conditions associated with depression, poor general health, physical inactivity, medical illness, and the use of numerous medications.[@B33][@B34] The prevalence of certain primary sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, and REM behavior disorder) increases with age and interferes with sleep, leading to daytime sleepiness. Obesity is known to be a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)[@B35][@B36] and a significant predictor of EDS, independent of underlying OSA.37 Previous studies have found lower socioeconomic status (including the education level) to be associated with worse sleeping patterns.[@B38][@B39] The present study found that EDS was associated with a lower level of education, which tends to be present in older Koreans, like in many other societies. A better characterization of the factors associated with a higher prevalence of EDS among people with lower levels of education is needed. EDS is the most frequent presenting symptom in subjects with OSA syndrome.[@B40][@B41] Although we did not perform polysomnography, the presence of snoring as a symptom of OSA might be correlated with EDS. Insomnia is a subjective symptom of insufficient or nonrestorative sleep despite there being an adequate opportunity to sleep, resulting in sleepiness during the daytime. We used the ISI but could not define primary insomnia and could not exclude co-morbidities of insomnia; nevertheless, it is well known that EDS is caused by insufficient sleep, and various types of sleep problems are linked to poor sleep quality, insomnia, misalignments of circadian rhythm (e.g., jet lag or shift work) and sleep-enhancing drugs.[@B17][@B19][@B27][@B42][@B43]\n\nUnmet sleep need, insomnia, and snoring were significantly associated with an increased risk of EDS in the present study after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. These results are similar to those of previous studies.[@B16][@B17][@B18][@B19][@B21][@B22][@B24][@B25][@B26][@B27][@B44] We attempted to elucidate whether EDS is directly linked to sleep duration or unmet sleep need. When sleep duration and unmet sleep need were examined separately, significant associations were found with EDS, but when sleep duration and unmet sleep need were examined together, unmet sleep need alone accounted for the risk of EDS, with the association between sleep duration and EDS disappearing. This result did not change after performing additional adjustments for insomnia and snoring. In short, unmet sleep need is independently associated with EDS, suggesting that sleep duration is not directly linked to the risk of EDS. These results suggest that measuring unmet sleep need would be a more direct way of detecting EDS than measuring the habitual sleep duration, since the basal sleep requirement for preventing daytime sleepiness may differ between natural short sleepers and natural long sleepers, and it is necessary to differentiate between short-duration sleepers with a decreased basal sleep need and those experiencing insufficient sleep.[@B28][@B45]\n\nOur study had several limitations that should be noted. First, the information on sleep duration was self-reported by the participants. However, previous studies have found adequate agreement between self-reported sleep durations and data obtained using actigraphic monitoring.[@B46][@B47] Thus, although self-administered questionnaires are not as accurate as actigraphy or polysomnography, they are widely used in population-based studies due to the method being rapid and simple to apply. Second, insufficient sleep may be influenced by subjectively perceived normative standards. For example, socioeconomic status and other factors may affect how subjects answer questions, thereby potentially introducing information bias.[@B48] Third, due to a survey limitation, we could not evaluate the presence of underlying primary sleep disorders such as OSA. Finally, this study had a cross-sectional design, and so causal relationships could not be elucidated.\n\nOur study has revealed the prevalence of EDS using ESS in a general population of Korean adults. According to our results, 11.9% of Korean adults have EDS. When sleep duration and unmet sleep need were examined together, only the effect of unmet sleep need was associated with EDS. EDS was associated with unmet sleep need, insomnia, snoring, and BMI after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. We suggest that the unmet sleep need of an individual is more important than the habitual sleep duration in terms of the relationship with EDS.\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from Soonchunhyang

        "text": "Resistance to malathion and deltamethrin in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) from western Venezuela.\nResistance to the insecticides deltamethrin and malathion and the enzymes associated with metabolic resistance mechanisms were determined in four field populations of Aedes aegypti (L.) from western Venezuela during 2008 and 2010 using the bottle assay and the microplate biochemical techniques. For deltamethrin, mortality rates after 1 h exposure and after a 24-h recovery period were determined to calculate the 50% knock-downconcentration (KC50) and the lethal concentration (LC50), respectively. For malathion, mortality was recorded at 24 h to determine the LC50. For deltamethrin, resistance ratios of knock-down resistance and postrecovery were determined by calculating the RRKC50 and RRLC50, comparing the KC50 and LC50 values of the field populations and those of the susceptible New Orleans strain. Knock-down resistance to deltamethrin was moderate in the majority of the populations in 2008 (RRKC50 values were between 5- and 10-fold), and only one population showed high resistance in 2010 (RRKC50 > 10-fold). Moderate and high postrecovery resistance to deltamethrin was observed in the majority of the populations for 2008 and 2010, respectively. There was significantly increased expression of glutathione-S-tranferases and mixed-function oxidases. All populations showed low resistance to malathion in 2008 and 2010 with significantly higher levels of alpha-esterases for 2008 and 2010 and beta-esterases for 2008."

        "text": "Higher operating temperatures for gas turbine engines are continuously sought in order to increase their efficiency. However, as operating temperatures increase, the high temperature durability of the components of the engine must correspondingly increase. Significant advances in high temperature capabilities have been achieved through the formulation of nickel and cobalt-base superalloys. Nonetheless, when used to form components of the turbine, combustor and augmentor sections of a gas turbine engine, such alloys alone are often susceptible to damage by oxidation and hot corrosion attack and may not retain adequate mechanical properties. For this reason, these components are often protected by an environmental and/or thermal-insulating coating, the latter of which is termed a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system. Ceramic materials, and particularly yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), are widely used as a thermal barrier coating (TBC), or topcoat, of TBC systems used on gas turbine engine components. These particular materials are widely employed because they can be readily deposited by plasma spray, flame spray and vapor deposition techniques. A commonly used type of TBC is a coating based on zirconia stabilized with yttria, for example about 93 wt. % zirconia stabilized with about 7 wt. % yttria. This general type of TBC has been reported in such United States patents as U.S. Pat. No. 4,055,705, U.S. Pat. No. 4,328,285, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,745, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring routine operation of the engine and aircraft, the coated surfaces, particularly those in or near the flowpath (intake, compression, combustion and exhaust) of the gas turbine engine, are subjected to heat, pressure and other forces can cause the coating to suffer localized damage such as spallation due to thermal fatigue and stress, defects, impact damage and other mechanical damage. For these reasons, the coated surfaces must be routinely inspected and meticulously repaired to avoid further damage to the coated surfaces and the underlying substrate. Maintenance personnel must inspect all visible surfaces, often requiring the use of flashlights, mirrors, and other inspection tools to access remote areas such as the small cooling holes and exhaust ports in a gas turbine engine. In the case of aircraft turbine engines and large power generation turbines, removing the turbine from service for repairs results in significant costs in terms of labor and downtime. For these reasons, removing components having TBCs that have suffered only localized damage such as spallation is not economically desirable. As a result, components identified as having only localized coating damage are often analyzed to determine whether the damage has occurred in a high stress area, and a judgment is then made as to the risk of damage to the turbine due to the reduced thermal protection of the component that could lead to catastrophic failure of the component.\nOnce a localized damaged coating area is located by inspection, and the decision is made to effect a field repair in situ, maintenance personnel must clean and prime the damaged area. Optionally, the field personnel may also apply a repair coating composition to the damaged surface, such as the compositions described in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,413,578, for example. Current tools for cleaning, priming and optionally applying a repair coating are inadequate. Known tools are often too large, too small, or otherwise insufficient to perform the cleaning, priming and repairs. For example, maintenance personnel often use spray bottles and other containers for dispensing cleaning solutions such as solvents and detergents, beakers containing primers and coating repair compositions, and multiple brushes for cleaning and applying cleaning solutions, primers and repair compositions. In addition to the cumbersome use of so many different items, this situation creates a safety hazard to the personnel as well as a mechanical hazard to subsequent operation of the engine. While maintenance protocols require an accounting of each item used in the engine area, the use of a large number of tools makes the accounting process difficult, and more prone to errors that can have catastrophic results.\nFor all these reasons, there exists a continuing need for maintenance tools that can be effectively and efficiently used in limited access areas of engine and flowpath areas to clean, prime, and optionally repair damaged coated surfaces. There is additionally a need for maintenance tools and cleaning methods that can be used to perform one or more of the tasks of cleaning, priming, and repairing of coated surfaces in situ.\nAccordingly, it would be desirable if a cleaning, priming and repair method were available that could be performed on localized damaged areas of TBC on turbine hardware in field and in situ, without necessitating that the component be removed from the turbine, so that downtime and scrappage are minimized."

SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n5\nPursuant to the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq., the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") delegated to Louisiana the responsibility for administering the Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\"LPDES\").  In exchange for its approval, EPA required Louisiana to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\") and the National Marine Fisheries Service (\"NMFS\") before issuing permits.  If FWS or NMFS determines that the proposed permit threatens endangered species--and if Louisiana refuses to modify the permit--EPA will veto the permit under its continuing oversight authority.  American Forest and Paper Association (\"AF & PA\") challenges this rule as exceeding EPA's authority under the CWA.  Because we agree that EPA lacked statutory authority, we grant the petition for review and vacate and remand the portion of the rule that imposes the consultation requirement and declares that EPA will veto any permit to which FWS or NMFS objects.\n\nI.\n\n6\nUnder the CWA, one needs a permit to discharge a pollutant.  At least as an initial matter, permitting authority is vested in EPA through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\").  EPA may, however, delegate permitting authority to a state if the state demonstrates that it will comply with a list of enumerated requirements and that it will monitor and enforce the terms of the permits.  See CWA § 402(b)(1)-(9), 33 U.S.C. § 1342(b)(1)-(9).  EPA does not enjoy wide latitude in deciding whether to approve or reject a state's proposed permit program.  \"Unless the Administrator of EPA determines that the proposed state program does not meet [the specified] requirements, he must approve the proposal.\"  Save the Bay, Inc. v. EPA, 556 F.2d 1282, 1285 (5th Cir.1977).\n\n\n7\nEPA retains oversight authority even when it delegates permitting authority to a state.  Should the agency determine that a state is not complying with the CWA, it may withdraw its approval of the state program.  EPA also retains oversight authority over individual permits issued under approved state programs.  States are required to submit permit applications and proposed permits to EPA;  the agency may veto a proposed permit if it concludes that the permit violates the CWA.  See CWA § 402(d), 33 U.S.C. § 1342(d).\n\n\n8\nUntil recently, EPA administered the permitting program in Louisiana through the NPDES.  Before issuing a permit, EPA chose to consult with FWS and NMFS to ensure that endangered species would not be threatened by the discharges contemplated in the permit.  When EPA announced plans to delegate the permitting program to Louisiana, environmental groups cried foul, pointing out that because the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\") does not apply to the states, nothing would prevent the issuance of permits that might harm endangered species.\n\n\n9\nEPA then devised the following scheme:  In exchange for approving Louisiana's program, EPA directed the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (\"LDEQ\") to submit proposed permits to FWS and NMFS for review.  If the federal agencies agree that the proposed permit does not threaten endangered species, the permit may be issued.  But if the federal agencies conclude that the permit does threaten endangered species--and if LDEQ refuses to modify the permit to the agencies' satisfaction--EPA will exercise its veto power and formally object to the permit.  Louisiana consented to this arrangement, and EPA issued its final rule.  See Approval of Application by Louisiana To Administer the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program, 61 Fed.Reg. 47,932 (1996).\n\n\n10\nEPA invoked CWA § 304(i), 33 U.S.C. § 1314(i), as authority for attaching this condition to its approval of Louisiana's program.  That section allows EPA to promulgate guidelines \"establishing the minimum procedural and other elements\" for state permitting programs.  The agency also pointed to ESA § 7(a)(2) as justifying its action.  That section provides:\n\n\n11\nEach Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary [of the Interior, Commerce, or Agriculture], insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency ... is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species....\n\n\n12\n16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2).  The spirit of this general mandate is echoed in the statement of congressional purpose underlying the ESA, 16 U.S.C. § 1531(c)(1), which declares it \"the policy of Congress that all Federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter.\"\n\nII.\n\n13\nAF & PA did not participate in the agency proceedings below--a silence that EPA says precludes AF & PA from raising its objection in this court.  The CWA grants the federal courts of appeals original jurisdiction over challenges to determinations regarding state permitting programs under § 402(b).  Although any \"interested person\" may seek review of EPA's permitting decisions, see CWA § 509(b)(1), 33 U.S.C. § 1369(b)(1), EPA argues that a party that fails to participate during the public comment period waives its claims.  The agency points to its extensive newspaper advertising as evidence that AF & PA was on notice of EPA's intent to approve Louisiana's program.\n\n\n14\nEPA has failed to identify any provision in the CWA that suggests a party's failure to comment waives its right to seek judicial review.  The statute allows \"any interested person\" that promptly files an objection to seek review in this court.  Other statutes allowing judicial review of agency decisions sweep far less broadly, requiring the petitioner to have been a party.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2344 (limiting right of review to \"aggrieved parties\").  We see nothing in the text of the statute that warrants the narrow reading EPA urges.\n\n\n15\nMoreover, we have never held that failure to raise an objection during the public notice and comment period estops a petitioner from raising it on appeal.  EPA presented the same argument to us long ago, but we rejected it, observing that \"EPA has cited no authority for the proposition that an argument not raised during the comment period may not be raised on review.\"  City of Seabrook, Tex. v. EPA, 659 F.2d 1349, 1360 n. 17 (Former 5th Cir.  Oct. 1981).  In that case, EPA--as it does again here--relied on United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952), involving a challenge to an Interstate Commerce Commission action by a party that participated in a hearing and could have appealed the hearing officer's decision to the Commission.  We characterized EPA's reliance on L.A. Tucker as \"badly misplaced.\"  City of Seabrook, 659 F.2d at 1360 n. 17.\n\n\n16\nWe conclude that AF & PA's failure to participate during the public comment period does not rob this court of jurisdiction.  Our decision in City of Seabrook remains valid:\n\n\n17\nThe rule urged by EPA would require everyone who wishes to protect himself from arbitrary agency action not only to become a faithful reader of the notices of proposed rulemaking published each day in the Federal Register, but a psychic able to predict the possible changes that could be made in the proposal when the rule is finally promulgated.  This is a fate this court will impose on no one.\n\n\n18\nId. at 1360-61 (internal footnotes omitted).  Estopping AF & PA from pursuing its claims would be especially unfair in that EPA modified its rule.  The version initially proposed did not contain the consultation requirement;  that provision was added only after environmental groups demanded additional protection for endangered species.  AF & PA's failure to monitor the rule's evolution throughout the public comment period does not constitute waiver.\n\n\n19\nFinally, we note that the concerns underlying the exhaustion doctrine are not implicated here.  That doctrine restrains courts from ruling on objections not considered by the agency by requiring a party to exhaust its administrative remedies before pursuing judicial review.  See Unemployment Compensation Comm'n v. Aragon, 329 U.S. 143, 155, 67 S.Ct. 245, 251, 91 L.Ed. 136 (1946).  During the public comment period, EPA was presented with detailed objections concerning the scope of endangered species protection under Louisiana's proposed program.2  (To be sure, these objections came from environmental groups seeking expanded protections, so it is ironic that AF & PA now seeks to preserve its claim on the basis of its opponents' complaints.)   In any event, because the public comments regarding the ESA were sufficiently specific to prompt EPA to adopt the provision contested here, the agency cannot reasonably claim that it has been denied the opportunity to consider the issue.\n\nIII.\n\n20\nBefore we can reach the merits of its claim, AF & PA must demonstrate that it has standing to sue.  It must first show that it has suffered an \"injury in fact\"--that is, an actual and imminent injury, not one that is merely conjectural or hypothetical.  It also must show a causal connection between its injury and the complained-of conduct.  Finally, it must establish that its injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, ----, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1163, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997).  EPA claims that AFPA cannot meet any of these requirements.\n\nA.\n\n21\nAF & PA's members include permit holders in Louisiana.  Although AF & PA has not alleged that any of its members has applied for a new permit or sought to modify an existing one, it argues that injury is imminent, in the form of costs of compliance with EPA's new rule, including delays in permitting and the added risk that an application will be denied.  EPA says AF & PA's alleged injury is purely hypothetical, because it rests on a chain of speculation.  In EPA's view, this chain is linked by a series of dubious assumptions about the circumstances under which EPA might exercise its veto power.\n\n\n22\nWe do not find the permit holders' injuries speculative.  As an initial matter, permits are not eternal:  They must be renewed every five years.  Modifications to existing permits must also be cleared with FWS and NMFS. Moreover, EPA has already identified the circumstances under which it will veto a proposed permit.  See 61 Fed.Reg. at 47,934 (\"EPA will formally object to the issuance of the draft permit if FWS determines that the action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed or proposed species or destroy designated critical habitat.\")  (emphasis added).  Permit holders' imminent need to comply, coupled with EPA's frank announcement of its intentions, belies the agency's claim that any injury is speculative.3\n\nB.\n\n23\nEPA next launches a redressability challenge, contending that Louisiana's voluntary commitment to cooperate with the federal agencies would withstand a court decision striking down the rule's consultation requirement.  EPA correctly points out that Louisiana is free to consult with FWS and NMFS in making permitting decisions.  But this argument misses the real question:  whether EPA may promulgate a rule requiring Louisiana to obtain the federal government's blessing before issuing a permit.  In this instance, a permissible end does not validate impermissible means.  EPA's redressability challenge, accordingly, is meritless.\n\nIV.\n\n24\nThe final threshold issue is ripeness.  In determining whether an issue is ripe for review, we must balance the fitness of the issues for judicial decision with the hardship to the parties of withholding review.  Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Traillour Oil Co., 987 F.2d 1138, 1153-54 (5th Cir.1993) (\"[T]he ripeness inquiry focuses on whether an injury that has not yet occurred is sufficiently likely to happen to justify judicial intervention.\").  Ordinarily we wait until a rule has been applied before granting review;  this prudential concern loses force, however, when the question presented is purely legal.  New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 833 F.2d 583, 587 (5th Cir.1987).\n\n\n25\nThe instant case concerns a purely legal issue:  whether EPA enjoys the statutory authority to require Louisiana, before it may issue a discharge permit, to consult with federal agencies regarding the impact on endangered species.  Contrary to EPA's assertion, there are no facts awaiting development that would aid our decision;  to the extent any factual questions even exist, they are overshadowed by the legal question that towers over this case.  Because deferring review will impose an immediate, significant burden on the petitioner--and because we are confronted with a pure question of law--this dispute is ripe for review.\n\nV.\n\n26\nEPA contends that its rule is authorized by CWA § 304(i), 33 U.S.C. § 1314(i), which directs EPA to promulgate guidelines governing state permitting programs under CWA § 402(b), 33 U.S.C. § 1342(b).  EPA also suggests that its decision is not only authorized but compelled by ESA § 7(a)(2), 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2).  That section directs federal agencies to consult with FWS and NMFS before undertaking any \"agency action,\" to ensure that the action will not threaten an endangered species.\n\nA.\n\n27\nWe review EPA's interpretation of the CWA in two steps.  Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  We first ask whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.  If so, we must defer to the clearly expressed congressional intent.  If not--if the statute is silent or ambiguous--we ask whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.  Id. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. at 2781-82.   We do not, however, accord Chevron deference to EPA's interpretation of the ESA, because the ESA is not a statute that EPA is charged with administering.  See Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638, 649-50, 110 S.Ct. 1384, 1391, 108 L.Ed.2d 585 (1990).\n\nB.\n\n28\nSpecifically, CWA § 402(b), 33 U.S.C. § 1342(b), provides that the EPA Administrator \"shall approve\" proposed state permitting programs that meet nine specified requirements.  The key question is whether EPA may deny a state's proposed program based on a criterion--the protection of endangered species--that is not enumerated in § 402(b).\n\n\n29\nEPA calls our attention to CWA § 304(i), 33 U.S.C. § 1314(i), construing that section as authorizing the agency to regard the nine requirements § 402(b) as minimum, not exhaustive, criteria.4  EPA further contends that because nothing in § 402(b) prohibits EPA from adding additional criteria, its interpretation of the statute is reasonable and worthy of deference under Chevron.\n\n\n30\nWe cannot agree.  The language of § 402(b) is firm:  It provides that EPA \"shall\" approve submitted programs unless they fail to meet one of the nine listed requirements.  We interpreted this language as non-discretionary in Save the Bay, Inc. v. EPA, 556 F.2d 1282 (5th Cir.1977), noting that \"[t]he Amendments [to the CWA] set out the full list of requirements a state program must meet....  Unless the Administrator of EPA determines that the proposed state program does not meet these requirements, he must approve the proposal.\"  Id. at 1285 & n. 3. See also Natural Resources Defense Council v. US EPA, 859 F.2d 156, 174 (D.C.Cir.1988);  Citizens for a Better Env't v. EPA, 596 F.2d 720, 722 (7th Cir.1979).\n\n\n31\nEPA's claim is further weakened by CWA § 402(b)(6), 33 U.S.C. § 1342(b)(6), which grants EPA veto power over a proposed permit if the Secretary of the Army concludes that the discharges contemplated by the permit would substantially impair anchorage and navigation.  Congress could have, but did not, grant EPA an analogous veto power to protect endangered species.\n\n\n32\nNothing in § 304(i) undermines this conclusion.  That subsection simply directs EPA to issue regulations governing the approval process for state programs.  There is no hint that Congress intended to grant EPA authority to erect additional hurdles to the permitting process beyond those expressly noted in § 402(b).  Moreover, neither section even mentions endangered species or the ESA.5  The statute's plain language directs EPA to approve proposed state programs that meet the enumerated criteria;  particularly in light of the command \"shall approve,\" § 304(i) cannot be construed to allow EPA to expand the list of permitting requirements.  Applying Chevron, we conclude that Congress has spoken directly to the precise question at issue:  EPA's discretion lies not in modifying the list of enumerated criteria, but simply in ensuring that those criteria are met.\n\nC.\n\n33\nIn American Iron & Steel Inst. v. EPA, 115 F.3d 979 (D.C.Cir.1997) (\"AISI \"), the court concluded that EPA may require states to include provisions in certain permitting programs to ensure the protection of endangered species.  EPA argues that AISI 's logic is applicable to the instant case.\n\n\n34\nAISI is distinguishable, however, in that the case arose under a different provision of the CWA-- § 118(c)(2), 33 U.S.C. § 1268(c)(2).  That section directs EPA to promulgate \"water quality guidance\" for the Great Lakes.  But § 118(c)(2) is structured quite differently from § 402:  The former grants EPA authority to specify pollutant limits for the Great Lakes and develop \"guidances\" to which state programs must conform;  the section does not direct the agency to approve state programs that meet certain requirements.\n\n\n35\nIn addition to this far broader grant of authority, § 118(c)(2) specifically mentions that EPA's development of pollutant limits should aim to protect aquatic life and wildlife in the Great Lakes.  The AISI court relied on this language in concluding that EPA did not exceed its statutory authority under § 118(c):\n\n\n36\nWe uphold this portion of the Guidance, but not because of the ESA.  Section 118(c)(2) provides that the Guidance \"shall specify numerical limits on pollutants in ambient Great Lakes waters to protect human health, aquatic life, and wildlife, and shall provide guidance to the Great Lakes States on minimum water quality standards ....\" (emphasis added) This is all the authority the EPA needed to promulgate regulations designed to protect endangered, threatened and other species in the Great Lakes System.\n\n\n37\n115 F.3d at 1003.  AISI 's reasoning, insofar as it concerns a section of the CWA that materially differs in language and purpose, is inapplicable here.\n\nD.\n\n38\nFinally, EPA argues that ESA § 7(a)(2), when construed alongside the Court's broad reading of the statute in Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 173, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2291, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978), compels EPA to do everything reasonably within its power to protect endangered species.  The flaw in this argument is that if EPA lacks the power to add additional criteria to CWA § 402(b), nothing in the ESA grants the agency the authority to do so.  Section 7 of the ESA merely requires EPA to consult with FWS or NMFS before undertaking agency action;  it confers no substantive powers.6\n\n\n39\nThe District of Columbia Circuit construed ESA § 7(a)(2) in Platte River Whooping Crane Trust v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm'n, 962 F.2d 27 (D.C.Cir.1992), holding that the statute \"does not expand the powers conferred on an agency by its enabling act,\" but rather directs the agencies to \"utilize\" their existing powers to protect endangered species.  Id. at 34.   In that case, the petitioner, Whooping Crane Trust, pressed virtually the same argument EPA advances here.  The court observed:\n\n\n40\nThe Trust reads section 7 essentially to oblige the [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] to do \"whatever it takes\" to protect the threatened and endangered species that inhabit the Platte River basin;  any limitations on FERC's authority contained in the [Federal Power Act] are implicitly superseded by this general command....  We think the Trust's interpretation of the ESA is far-fetched.\n\n\n41\nId. We agree that the ESA serves not as a font of new authority, but as something far more modest:  a directive to agencies to channel their existing authority in a particular direction.  The upshot is that EPA cannot invoke the ESA as a means of creating and imposing requirements that are not authorized by the CWA.\n\n\n42\nAccordingly, we GRANT the petition for review and VACATE the portion of the rule that imposes the consultation requirement and declares that EPA will reject any proposed permit to which FWS or NMFS objects.  This matter is REMANDED to the EPA for further appropriate proceedings.7\n\n\n\n1\n District Judge of the Northern District of Texas, sitting by designation\n\n\n2\n For example, an environmental group from Tulane Law School specifically charged that \"the Endangered Species Act will become unavailable to citizens if [the Louisiana] DEQ becomes the administrator of the NPDES program.\"\n\n\n3\n EPA's claim that AF & PA has not shown causation--a link between the agency's decision and the permit holders' injury-in-fact--is also premised on the allegedly speculative nature of the injury.  It fails for the same reason\n\n\n4\n Section 304(i) provides:  \"The Administrator shall ... promulgate guidelines establishing the minimum procedural and other elements of any State program under Section 1342 of this title which shall include ... monitoring requirements ... reporting requirements ... enforcement provisions;  and ... funding, personnel qualifications, and manpower requirements....\"\n\n\n5\n EPA's own regulations identifying the grounds on which the agency might object to state permits are similarly silent:  They make no mention of protection of endangered species.  See 40 C.F.R. § 123.44(c)\n\n\n6\n Whether EPA's approval of Louisiana's permitting program constitutes \"agency action\" for ESA purposes is largely beside the point.  Even if EPA were required to consult with the agencies before approving Louisiana's program, EPA lacks authority to modify the plain language of the CWA by adding to the list of enumerated requirements\n\n\n7\n The Motion of Amici Curiae for Clarification or Partial Reconsideration is denied as moot\n\n\n"

Proliferation response of lymphocytes from diabetic rats was significantly reduced under Con A (43%) and LPS (46%) stimulation as compared with the control group. Insulin (166 microM) promoted a marked increase of lymphocyte proliferation (7.5-fold) in the control group and this response was much lower (2.6-fold) in lymphocyte from diabetic rats. Cells were also cultured in medium containing glucose at 5, 10 or 20 mM. High glucose concentration (20 mM) caused a marked inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation reaching the values of the diabetic group. In lymphocytes from control rats, the degree of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation was gradually increased, whereas that of cells from diabetic rats was much lower in response to insulin. In lymphocytes obtained from control rats, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was time-dependent on insulin. In cells from diabetic rats, the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was higher than that of control rats, however, there was no further phosphorylation after insulin addition. We conclude that the response of lymphocyte proliferation from diabetic rats to Con A and LPS stimuli is decreased but insulin was able to promote a significant proliferative effect on these cells. Also, high glycemia in addition to the lack of insulin participates in the reduced proliferation capacity of lymphocytes from diabetic rats."

        "text": "MediPharm Labs Signs $35 Million Private Label Cannabis Oil Sale Agreement with Option for Additional $13.5 Million\n\nTORONTO, Feb. 12, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — MediPharm Labs Corp. (TSXV: LABS) (OTCQB: MLCPF) (“MediPharm”) a leader in specialized, research-driven cannabis extraction and cannabinoid isolation, is pleased to announce that its wholly-owned subsidiary, MediPharm Labs Inc. (“MediPharm Labs” or the “Company”), has entered into a significant sales agreement with a leading Licensed Producer to supply approximately $35 million of private label purified cannabis oil concentrates. Under the terms of the agreement, the Licensed Producer will immediately purchase upfront $7.66 million of cannabis oil concentrate from MediPharm Labs’ inventory in February 2019. In addition, the Licensed Producer will purchase a minimum of $27 million of cannabis oil concentrate over a 12-month period commencing March 2019, with an option to purchase an additional $13.5 million over the same period, bringing the total potential aggregate value of the agreement to over $48 million to February 2020.\n\nMediPharm Labs’ private label program is a high margin business for the Company, whereby it opportunistically procures dry cannabis flower and trim from its thirteen product supply partners, to produce proprietary cannabis oil concentrate products for resale globally on a private label basis. This is MediPharm Labs’ fourth private label sales agreement to date. In total, these four agreements have aggregate potential value of over $85 million in the 15-month period that commenced December 2018.\n\nAs the cannabis industry continues to rapidly grow and evolve, MediPharm Labs has quickly established itself as a dominant player and leading provider of private label cannabis oil concentrates to other Licensed Producers and branded product manufacturers. We have also demonstrated the permanent need for a specialized extraction provider to fulfill and secure the cannabis supply chain for medical and recreational consumers.\n\nPat McCutcheon, CEO of MediPharm Labs\n\nWith our significant first mover advantage, deep expertise, leading-edge proprietary technology to manufacture and develop high-quality cannabis oil and concentrate products at commercial scale, we have quickly been able to execute several major contracts already and continue to see robust demand for our specialized products and services and are well positioned to achieve strong revenue growth as a dominant extraction company in the cannabis industry.\n\nAs an agnostic supplier of pharmaceutical grade cannabis oil concentrates to the global cannabis industry, MediPharm Labs has demonstrated its ability to strengthen and further secure the domestic supply chain for high-demand cannabis oil. This new supply agreement, combined with a large, long-term oil supply agreement previously announced with Canopy Growth Corporation, represents less than 10% of MediPharm Labs’ annual extraction capacity of 150,000 Kg, which is currently being expanded to 250,000 Kg of annual extraction capacity, with completion expected Q2 2019.\n\nTo date, MediPharm Labs has completed four private label wholesale agreements for cannabis oil concentrate supply (including Canopy Growth Corporation); five long-term cannabis concentrate program (tolling) agreements with James E. Wagner Cultivation Corp., Emerald Health Therapeutics, Inc., INDIVA Limited, The Supreme Cannabis Company, Inc. and TerrAscend Corp. Additionally, the Company has completed bulk purchases and/or off-take agreements with thirteen Licensed Producers securing dried cannabis supply to build MediPharm’s oil inventories for private label sale. The Company also continues to make progress on new partnership agreements with additional Licensed Producers and branded product manufacturers for cannabis private label manufacturing, as well as partnerships to purchase cannabis concentrates for global export for private label and research and development.\n\nAbout MediPharm Labs Corp.\n\nFounded in 2015, MediPharm Labs is a pioneer in the cannabis industry and has the distinction of being the first company in Canada to become a licensed producer for cannabis oil production under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) without first receiving a cannabis cultivation licence. This expert focus on cannabis concentrates from its cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) and ISO standard-built clean rooms and critical environments laboratory, allows MediPharm Labs to work with its established, Health Canada-approved cultivation partners to produce pharmaceutical-grade cannabis oil with a competitive advantage. MediPharm Labs is research-driven and focused on downstream secondary extraction methodology, distillation, and cannabinoid isolation and purification. MediPharm Labs provides B2B contract processing of cannabis to Canadian authorized licensed producers and appropriate international growers, supplying integrity-assured cannabis oil to qualified companies for sale under their own brand. In addition, MediPharm Labs will supply raw materials, formulations, processing and packaging for the creation of ready-to-sell advanced derivative products. MediPharm Labs was awarded Start-up of the Year at the recent Canadian Cannabis Awards hosted by Lift & Co.\n\nThrough its subsidiary, MediPharm Labs Australia Pty. Ltd., MediPharm has also completed its application process with the federal Office of Drug Control to extract and import medical cannabis products in Australia.\n\nOriginal press release\n\nGet ahead of the crowd by signing up for 420 Investor, the largest & most comprehensive premium subscription service for cannabis traders and investors since 2013.\n\nPublished by NCV Newswire The NCV Newswire by New Cannabis Ventures aims to curate high quality content and information about leading cannabis companies to help our readers filter out the noise and to stay on top of the most important cannabis business news.

Here we give a rigorous derivation of a tractable expression for the thermostatted nonlinear response of classical many body systems to time-dependent dissipative fields. The theory also allows for the concurrent parametric transformation of the system Hamiltonian. Our analysis shows once again the intimate relationship between nonequilibrium free-energy relations such as the Jarzynski equality and nonlinear response theory.

        "text": "Q:\n\nTroubleshooting a DIY Ion Thruster\n\nBeen following a Make-Magazine article on how to make your own ion thruster:\nhttps://makezine.com/projects/ionic-thruster/\nWent through the tutorial step by step, not seeming to get any thrust out of my thruster. I've checked the conductivity between the nails and the copper wire, they all conduct. I've checked the conductivity between each copper tubing piece and the copper wire, they all conduct.  The distance between the nails and the copper tubing looks about the same at it is in the tutorial.\nOne suggestion I had is that my nails aren't perfectly perfectly centered, but I'm not sure if there's anything else besides this that leads to this setup not putting out any thrust.\nCaution: Do not try this at home! It uses a 30 kV AC neon light power supply.\nI've followed the instructions in this video, including the recommendations for safety:\n\nHere's my build following the tutorial:\n\nA:\n\nThe instructional video shows a 30kv transformer providing the electromotive force for the ion engine/desk fan.\nThe user-created make video provides a clear reading of a 10kv transformer. That appears to be a strong indicator for lack of strength in the build.\nChuck up a set of nails in an electric drill and sharpen the points as suggested by uhoh, then pump up the volume... oops, increase the voltage with a more powerful transformer.\nThe tutorial video suggests a one-inch spacing for the exhaust nozzles. The maker video appears to be proportionally similar, but I suspect that no harm would come from bringing the ion destination a bit closer to the emitter. Not too close, perhaps another five to six millimeters.\nIt's difficult to fathom science in Imperial units, but these videos show that it works too.\n\nA:\n\nI very strongly suspect the sharpness of the points on the nails is key. This relies on field ionization of the air, and that is caused by points on the nails sharp enough so that electric fields near the tip are sufficiently high (of order volts/Angstrom) that they will either rip an electron off of individual molecules or atoms in the air producing positive ions, or add an extra electron producing negative ions.\n\nField desorption (FD) is a method of ion formation used in mass spectrometry (MS) in which a high-potential electric field is applied to an emitter with a sharp surface, such as a razor blade, or more commonly, a filament from which tiny \"whiskers\" have formed.\n\nSee also for example: \n\nelectrostatic fluid acceleration; physical principles\nair ionizer\nelectrostatic precipitator\n\nSeparating the electron from a neutral atom or molecule is hard work and usually has low efficiency. In real ion thrusters for space application, the majority of the weight and power consumption are a result of the ionizing aspects of the design, rather than the acceleration aspects.\nYou'll need to find a way to either sharpen the nails, or produce some whiskers on them. I think this was omitted from the tutorial you are following.\n\nbelow: Slide 52 from Ion sources Ionization and desorption methods explains that the extremely strong field of order 1E+10 V/m needed to ionize atoms is obtained by a needle at 10 kV potential when the radius of curvature of the tip is decreased to 10 microns. As long as the distance to ground is large, it matters very little if it's 1cm or 10cm. From the point of view of the field at the sharp tip, that's nearly infinity. Almost all of the potential drop happens in the first millimeter or so, and the field is only high enough to ionize atoms or molecules at the very tip.\n\nField Emission Electric Propulsion (FEEP)\nThis principle is also used in some designs for electric thrusters for small spacecraft. The implementation is a little different though. Instead of a metal point in a gas, the needle is hollow and a liquid propellant is introduced into the capillary space. When there is a high field, the liquid naturally forms a cusp or point called a Taylor cone. Individual atoms will become ionized and leave the surface. \nWhen operated differently, the Taylor cone will reach a mechanical instability and ionized droplets will be formed. This is called Electrospray ionization and is distinct from a field ionization ion source.\nHere's one example of an electrospray thruster with an array of microfabricated sharp points.\n\nField-emission electric propulsion (FEEP) is an advanced electrostatic space propulsion concept, a form of ion thruster, that uses liquid metal (usually either caesium, indium or mercury) as a propellant. A FEEP device consists of an emitter and an accelerator electrode. A potential difference of the order of 10 kV is applied between the two, which generates a strong electric field at the tip of the metal surface. The interplay of electric force and surface tension generates surface instabilities which give rise to Taylor cones on the liquid surface. At sufficiently high values of the applied field, ions are extracted from the cone tip by field evaporation or similar mechanisms, which then are accelerated to high velocities (typically 100 km/s or more).\n\n"

Julian of J.R. Julian, P.A., Wilmington, for petitioner Kara B. Rubenstein.\nJosy W. Ingersoll (argued), and William J. Wade, Wilmington, for Board of Bar Examiners.\nBefore VEASEY, C.J., WALSH and HOLLAND, JJ.\n*1132 HOLLAND, Justice:\nKara B. Rubenstein (\"Rubenstein\") has petitioned this Court, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 52(f). Rubenstein contends that, under the facts and circumstances presented, this Court should direct the Board of Bar Examiners (\"Board\") to issue a certificate that she is qualified for admission to the Delaware Bar. Supr.Ct.R. 52(e); B.R. 52.1. This Court has concluded that Rubenstein's petition for relief should be granted.\n\nFacts\nRubenstein received a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a juris doctorate from the Temple University Law School. Rubenstein first applied for admission to the Delaware Bar in 1990. She made subsequent applications in 1991, 1992, and 1993. In 1990, Rubenstein did not achieve a passing score on the Professional Conduct Examination or either portion of the Delaware Bar Examination, i.e., the essay section or the Multistate Bar Examination (\"MBE\") section. See B.R. 52.4 and 52.5. In 1991, Rubenstein passed the separate Professional Conduct Examination, but once again did not pass the Bar Examination. In 1992, Rubenstein achieved a passing score of 137 on the MBE section, but failed the Bar Examination by not achieving a passing score on the essay section.\nFrom 1989 to 1990, Rubenstein served as a law clerk to the President Judge of the Delaware Superior Court. In the fall of 1990, Rubenstein was certified under Supreme Court Rule 55. That rule provides for limited permission to practice law in Delaware's courts as a part of certain public programs.\nIn 1990, in accordance with the limited practice provisions of Rule 55, Rubenstein became employed by the Department of Justice of the State of Delaware as an Assistant Deputy Attorney General. Rubenstein worked as an attorney in that capacity for a period of two years until December 1992.[1] As an Assistant Deputy Attorney General, Rubenstein prosecuted driving under the influence and other criminal cases in the Court of Common Pleas in New Castle County. She also appeared in the Superior Court on habitual offender motions in motor vehicle cases and on motions to reinstate motor vehicle licenses.\nThe record before the Board included evidence of Rubenstein's competence and ability to practice law in the Delaware Superior Court and the Court of Common Pleas during her tenure as an Assistant Deputy Attorney General. That evidence included letters from the Judge she clerked for in the Superior Court, as well as letters from several other judges she had appeared before in the Superior Court and the Court of Common Pleas. An experienced member of the Delaware *1133 Bar, who was frequently Rubenstein's courtroom adversary, wrote to the Board on her behalf, as follows:\nIn permitting the admission of an applicant to the Delaware Bar, the Board must always be concerned with whether or not the applicant can competently practice law in this state. That answer cannot always be gleaned from someone's test score. As a result of my unique opportunity to observe Kara Rubenstein practice for over a year in two of the busiest courts of this state under Supreme Court Rule 55, I can unequivocally state she is well qualified to do so.\nIn support of her petition, the Attorney General of Delaware also wrote to the Board that, as an Assistant Deputy Attorney General, Rubenstein was a \"competent and diligent\" practitioner and that he found it \"inexplicable\" that Rubenstein had been unable to pass the Delaware Bar Examination.\nAfter three unsuccessful attempts to pass the Bar Examination, Rubenstein sought an expert's explanation for the anomalous dichotomy between her inability to pass the Bar Examination and her undisputed ability to function effectively as a prosecuting attorney in Delaware courts, pursuant to this Court's limited practice rule. Supr.Ct.R. 55. After careful testing, Rubenstein was advised that she suffered from a learning disability, which had been previously undiagnosed. The exact nature of the disability had no bearing on her intelligence or acumen but related exclusively to the means by which Rubenstein processed information.\n\nRubenstein's 1993 Board Petition\nIn April 1993, Rubenstein filed a petition with the Board requesting an exercise of its discretion to permit her a fourth opportunity to take the Bar Examination. B.R. 52.8(e). Rubenstein's petition alleged that she suffered from a learning disability, which had been previously undiagnosed. In support of her petition, Rubenstein presented to the Board a report prepared by William F. Shaw, M.Ed. (\"Shaw\"), concerning his evaluation of Rubenstein's learning disability. Shaw's report stated, in part:\nThe 21 point discrepancy between the verbal and performance abilities suggest that her learning style is that of a linguistic, sequential processor of information rather than a simultaneous processor. In the latter information is presented all at one time rather than in a sequence. If client's tests are more similar to the latter, for example if the fact patterns are presented all at once and client has to come up with a solution, she will do less well than if she is able to develop a problem sequentially as she would do in her criminal prosecutor role.\nDue to the large discrepancy between the verbal and performance abilities, the verbal measure is used as an expectancy of achievement as the Full Scale I.Q. represents a meaningless average. In this regard client's current measures of achievement are not significantly below her measure of expectancy, but the overlays of a learning disability and the learning processing difficulties still exist. The reader is reminded to once again look at the qualitative behavior observations during the reading tests. Moving one's head rather than to read with her eyes, especially for an individual with some superior abilities, speaks out boldly in terms of the diagnosis of a learning disability. In addition the observable mouthing of words as she reads, supposedly silently, is a further indication of an inefficient and maldeveloped reading process.\nShaw's report made the following recommendation to the Board:\n\nIn order to compensate for her disability, unlimited or at least extended time should be granted for the bar examination. This is assuming that the Testing Committee, based upon the new information reported in this examination, would reconsider and allow her to take the test again. The increased time allowed will grant more opportunity for client to read and reread items in order to give additional input [emphasis added].\nThe Shaw report concluded with the observation that Rubenstein's learning disability would not impair her law practice. In fact, the report stated that Rubenstein \"has a *1134 facility for the practice of law and is encouraged to pursue that interest.\" In addition, Rubenstein supported her petition to the Board with a letter from the Deputy Attorney General who had supervised her Rule 55 practice. Her supervisor represented to the Board that Rubenstein's \"learning disability had no discernible impact on her ability to practice law in the criminal courts, something the tests cannot show.\"\n\nBoard's 1993 Response\nOn June 11, 1993, the Board informed Rubenstein that it had granted her petition to take the Delaware Bar Examination for a fourth time. The Board's letter to Rubenstein also stated that based upon the medical evidence of her learning disability, accommodations would be made for her to take the essay portions of the examination. Those accommodations consisted of the Board's permission for Rubenstein to take the essay section in a separate room and to have one additional hour for each three-hour essay session. The Board decided that Rubenstein would not be permitted additional time for the MBE section.[2]\n\nRubenstein's 1993 Results\nWith the accommodation of additional time on the essay section, Rubenstein passed that portion of the 1993 Delaware Bar Examination. However, she received a score of 128 on the MBE, the examination she had passed in 1992 with a score of 137. That score was two points less than the minimum MBE score of 130 required by the rules of the Board. B.R. 52.4(c). Consequently, Rubenstein was informed that she had failed the 1993 Bar Examination.\nRubenstein petitioned the Board. She requested to be certified by the Board as being qualified for admission to the Delaware Bar, notwithstanding the two-point insufficiency of her MBE score in 1993. Rubenstein's petition was considered by the Board. Her petition was denied by the Board in a letter dated November 17, 1993.\n\nStandard of Review Rubenstein's Contention\nRubenstein has appealed to this Court for relief from the Board's action. Supr.Ct.R. 52. The Board's ruling would prevent Rubenstein from ever gaining admission to the Delaware Bar. Consequently, the Board's denial of Rubenstein's petition has affected her \"substantial rights,\" as required by Supreme Court Rule 52(f). Therefore, it is appropriate for this Court to consider the merits of Rubenstein's petition for relief.\nThis Court will not set aside the determination of the Board as to an applicant's professional competence unless the applicant demonstrates fraud, coercion, arbitrariness, or manifest unfairness. In re Reardon, Del. Supr., 378 A.2d 614, 618 (1977). Rubenstein does not allege that the Board conducted itself in either a fraudulent or a coercive manner. Rather, she contends that the Board's decision to grant her additional time on the essays but not on the MBE section of the Bar Examination was both arbitrary and manifestly unfair.\nRubenstein argues that the Board's accommodations to her during the 1993 Bar Examination were an unreasonable response to her undisputed learning disability. Rubenstein asserts that she has demonstrated her professional competence by passing the essay section of the Bar Examination in 1993 and the MBE section of the Bar Examination in 1992. Accordingly, Rubenstein asks this Court to direct the Board to suspend the application of Board Rule 52.4(c), which requires an applicant to achieve specified minimum scores on both sections of the Delaware Bar Examination in the same administration of that test, and to certify her as qualified for admission to the Delaware Bar. Compare In *1135 re Hudson, Del.Supr., 402 A.2d 369, 371 (1979).\n\nDelaware Bar Admission Certification Requirements\nNo applicant can be certified by the Board as qualified for admission to the Bar of this Court unless he or she has: first, complied with each of the requirements of Supreme Court Rule 52; second, achieved a passing score on the Professional Conduct Examination; and third, achieved a passing score on the Bar Examination. B.R. 52.1. The Board acknowledges that Rubenstein has satisfied each of the requirements of Supreme Court Rule 52 and achieved a passing score on the Professional Conduct Examination.[3] Therefore, the only issue before this Court relates to Rubenstein's performance on the Bar Examination.\nThe Bar Examination consists of two sections: the Multistate Bar Examination (\"MBE\") administered by the National Conference of Bar Examiners and twelve essays on certain enumerated subjects, as determined by the Board. B.R. 52.4(b). \"An applicant shall be deemed to have passed the Bar Examination if he [or she] achieves a scaled score of not less than 130 on the MBE and an average of not less than 65.0 on all of the twelve essay questions on the Bar Examination.\" B.R. 52.4(c). The latter provision is subject to the additional requirement that the applicant \"shall not have received a grade of less than 65.0 on more than five of the said essay questions.\" Id.\n\nRubenstein's Disability Board's Discretion Exercised Fourth Application Granted\nRubenstein failed the Bar Examination in three successive years. An applicant, who has failed to pass the Bar Examination three times, seeking to be afforded a fourth opportunity to take that test, has the burden of providing the Board with evidence:\n(i) That there existed physical, emotional, or other good reason constituting mitigating circumstances for the applicant's failure to pass 1 or more of the prior examinations; and\n(ii) That such reason, or reasons, have been resolved and the applicant knows of no impediment to his preparation for the fourth examination.\nB.R. 52.8(e).\nThe Board was satisfied that the evidence presented by Rubenstein of her previously undiagnosed learning disability constituted a mitigating circumstance for her failure to pass the Bar Examination in the past. Id. This satisfied the Board rule's first requirement \"[t]hat there existed physical, emotional, or other good reason constituting mitigating circumstances\" for her failure to pass one or more of the prior examinations. B.R. 52(e)(i). Since Rubenstein's learning disability was of a continuing nature, the Board realized that it was impossible for her to attest to its resolution, which is the second requirement of the Board's rule regarding an application to take the Bar Examination for a fourth time. B.R. 52.8(e)(ii).\nThe Board properly recognized, however, that the continuing nature of Rubenstein's learning disability was not only (1) an improper basis to deny her petition to take the Bar Examination a fourth time but also (2) required it to make reasonable accommodations for her learning disability if she was permitted to take the Bar Examination for the fourth time. The Board decided to give Rubenstein time and one-third to take the essay section of the Bar Examination but no additional time to take the MBE section. Our review of the Board's action must necessarily involve a consideration of both the factual evidence presented to the Board and the applicable law.\n\nBar Examinations Americans with Disabilities Act\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213 *1136 (West Supp.1993), became effective on January 26, 1992. The United States Department of Justice promulgated regulations to implement the ADA's statutory mandate. 28 C.F.R. pts. 35-36 (1991). The Department of Justice also prepared a section-by-section analysis of its regulations. Id. In 1991, prior to the ADA becoming effective, the United States Department of Justice and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission published the Americans with Disabilities Act Handbook.\nThe ADA has been described as a \"national mandate to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.\" Morrissey, The Americans with Disabilities Act: The Disabling of the Bar Examination Process?, The Bar Examiner, May 1993, at 9, 9. It \"imposes new standards of conduct upon bar examiners and similar entities ... with respect to disabled individuals [who are] pursuing professional careers.\" Id. The extent to which the ADA applies to bar examinations has been the subject of recent scholarly analysis. See Rogers, The ADA, Title VII and the Bar Examination: The Nature and Extent of the ADA's Coverage of Bar Examinations, 36 How.L.J. 1 (1993). The issues that confront boards of bar examiners in complying with the ADA have also been carefully considered by two special counsel to the National Conference of Bar Examiners. Fedo & Brown, Accommodating the Disabled Under the ADA: The Issues for Bar Examiners, The Bar Examiner, Aug. 1992, at 6.\nThe ADA provides that an individual is disabled if, inter alia, he or she has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of his or her major life activities. 42 U.S.C.A. § 12102(2). Once such a disability has been established, the ADA generally requires the persons or entities designated by the Act to make reasonable accommodations or modifications for the disability. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12112, 12131(2), 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 12184(b)(2)(A). Title II of the ADA provides:\nSubject to the provisions of this [title], no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\n42 U.S.C.A. § 12132.\nAdmission to the Delaware bar is governed exclusively by this Court. In re Hudson, Del.Supr., 402 A.2d 369 (1979). The application and testing procedures are administered by the Board, which is appointed by this Court. Supr.Ct.R. 51 and 52. The Board, as an instrumentality of this Court, constitutes a public entity within the meaning of Title II. See 42 U.S.C.A. § 12131(1); Supr.Ct.R. 51. See also Fedo & Brown, Accommodating the Disabled Under the ADA: The Issues for Bar Examiners, The Bar Examiner, Aug. 1992, at 6, 6. Consequently, as a public entity, the Board must make reasonable accommodations to prevent the de facto exclusion \"which may occur when disabled but otherwise qualified individuals are limited by standard administrative or other operating procedures from participating fully in the examination process.\" Fedo & Brown, Accommodating the Disabled Under the ADA: The Issues for Bar Examiners, The Bar Examiner, Aug. 1992, at 6, 6.\nThe regulations implementing the ADA state that Title II is applicable to licensing and certification \"programs.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(6). Title II and its regulations, however, contain no specific standards for the administration of bar examinations, or of other professional licensing tests. Nevertheless, specific guidance is available regarding the administration of examinations in the regulations promulgated to implement Title III of the ADA. Title III, in part, provides:\n\nAny person that offers examinations or courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes shall offer such examinations or courses in a place and manner accessible to persons with disabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements for such individuals.\n42 U.S.C.A. § 12189 (emphasis added).\nTitle III of the ADA generally applies only to private entities. However, in the interpretive analysis of its Title III regulations, the United States Department of Justice has taken *1137 the position that \"[e]xaminations covered by this section would include a bar exam.\" ADA Handbook, III-100, Oct. 1991.[4]See 28 C.F.R. § 36.309(a). See also Amicus Curiae Memorandum of Law for the United States, at 4 n. 2, Rosenthal v. New York State Bd. of Law Examiners, (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 1992) (No. 92 Civ. 1100). At least one federal court has agreed with the Department of Justice's construction of the ADA by applying both Title II and III with regard to the administration of a bar examination. D'Amico v. New York State Bd. of Law Examiners, 813 F.Supp. 217, 221 (W.D.N.Y.1993).[5]\n\nAdditional Time A Reasonable Accommodation\nThe purpose of the ADA \"is to place those with disabilities on an equal footing and not to give them an unfair advantage.\" D'Amico v. New York State Bd. of Law Examiners, 813 F.Supp. at 221. Compare Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 413, 99 S.Ct. 2361, 2370, 60 L.Ed.2d 980 (1979) (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973).[6] The integrity of the examination process has been an important consideration for the federal courts in reviewing the reasonableness of accommodations made by testing authorities pursuant to other disabilities legislation. See, e.g., Pandazides v. Virginia Bd. of Educ., 752 F.Supp. 696, 697 (E.D.Va.1990), rev'd and remanded, 946 F.2d 345 (4th Cir.1991). The ADA also provides authority, for example, that a testing authority may refuse to provide an auxiliary aid or service to a disabled person if it meets the burden of establishing \"that offering [the] particular auxiliary aid would fundamentally alter the measurement of the skills or knowledge the examination is intended to test or would result in an undue burden.\" 28 C.F.R. § 36.309(b)(3) (1991).\nA learning disability, such as Rubenstein's, is a condition which the ADA recognizes should be accommodated. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.104(1)(i), 36.104(1)(i). The regulations promulgated under Title III describe several kinds of accommodations that may be required in the examination process, as well as the limitations on such accommodations that may be applicable. 28 C.F.R. § 36.309 (1991). Those regulations specifically state that \"[r]equired modifications to an examination may include changes in the length of time permitted for completion of the examination.\" 28 C.F.R. § 36.309(b)(2) (emphasis added).\nThe record reflects that the Board found that Rubenstein had established that she was a person with a learning disability. The ADA Handbook provides that \"[e]xaminers may require evidence that an applicant is entitled to modifications.\" ADA Handbook, III-102, Oct. 1991. The ADA Handbook suggests that appropriate documentation for a requested accommodation \"might include a letter from a physician or other professional.\" Id. (emphasis added).\nIn this case, Rubenstein requested the Board to accommodate her learning disability by allowing her additional time to take the *1138 Bar Examination. She documented her request with Shaw's expert report. Shaw's report made the following recommendation to the Board:\n\nIn order to compensate for her disability, unlimited or at least extended time should be granted for the bar examination. This is assuming that the Testing Committee, based upon the new information reported in this examination, would reconsider and allow her to take the test again. The increased time allowed will grant more opportunity for client to read and reread items in order to give additional input [emphasis added].\nShaw's report recommended that Rubenstein be afforded additional time to take the Bar Examination. Shaw's professional recommendation was unqualified. It did not differentiate between the essay section and the MBE section of the Bar Examination with respect to Rubenstein's need for additional time to accommodate her learning disability.\n\nTime Afforded Rubenstein An Inconsistent Accommodation\nThis Court has held that appellate review regarding an exercise of the Board's discretion requires a determination that the factual findings are supported by the record and that the Board's decision is the product of a logical and orderly deductive process. In re Green, Del.Supr., 464 A.2d 881, 887 (1983). It has been observed that the sine qua non for bar examiners' compliance with the ADA \"[is] principally a matter of making reasonable accommodations for disabled individuals to take the examination and to communicate with the licensing board.\" Fedo & Brown, Accommodating the Disabled Under the ADA: The Issues for Bar Examiners, The Bar Examiner, Aug. 1992, at 6, 6-7. The same authors astutely note that courts are more likely to uphold bar examiners' decisions if they produce an evidentiary record showing that reasonable efforts were made to accommodate a disabled applicant's needs. Id. at 8. Accord Petition of Nenno, Del. Supr., 472 A.2d 815, 818 (1983) (Board's decision must be supported by substantial evidence).\nIn Rubenstein's case, the record is devoid of any evidentiary basis to support the Board's decision to disregard the recommendation of Rubenstein's expert. In addition, the Board's ultimate decision does not reflect that it was the product of an orderly and logical deductive process. In re Green, 464 A.2d at 887. The Board's decision to afford Rubenstein additional time (one-third) to take the essay section but no additional time to take the MBE section of the Bar Examination, without any explanation, was internally inconsistent. The Board's action was also inconsistent with the MBE guidelines established by the National Conference of Bar Examiners.\n\nMultistate Bar Examination Task Force on Disabled Applicants\nThe MBE portion of the Delaware Bar Examination is \"administered by the National Conference of Bar Examiners.\" B.R. 52.4(b). In October 1990, the Board of Managers of the National Conference adopted the following revision to Standard 22 of the Code of Recommended Standards for Bar Examiners:\nWithout impairing the integrity of the examination process, the bar examining authority should adopt and publish procedures allowing applicants with documented disabilities to have assistance, equipment or additional time as is reasonably necessary under the circumstances to assure their fair and equal opportunity to perform on the examination.\nSmith, NCBE Guidelines For Testing Disabled Applicants, The Bar Examiner, Feb. 1991, at 28, 28. The revision to Standard 22 was proposed by the National Conference of Bar Examiners Task Force on Disabled Applicants. Id. That Task Force also developed \"guidelines for jurisdictions reviewing requests for special accommodations for disabled applicants,\" i.e. Considerations in Testing Applicants with Disabilities. Id.\nThe work of the Task Force was reported upon by Jane Peterson Smith, the Director of Testing of the National Conference of Bar Examiners. Id. According to Smith:\n\n*1139 The most difficult issue the task force considered was the amount of extra time to allow for disabled applicants, particularly for those with learning disabilities. The task force concluded that time and one-half was an appropriate accommodation for most disabled applicants because there is evidence that the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE) is not a \"speeded\" examination.\nThe Task Force on Disabled Applicants also designed a standardized application form for bar examiners to use for those persons requesting testing accommodations. Id. at 30-31 (Appendix I and II). That form is particularly instructive in Rubenstein's case. The choices in Section V, \"Accommodations granted for the Multistate Bar Examination,\" regarding \"[e]xtra testing time\" are: time and one-half; double time; more than double time; and other. (Appendix II). The form also includes a separate Section VI, which relates to \"[a]ccommodations granted for the rest of the bar examination,\" e.g., the essays. Id.\n\nBoard's Decision Manifestly Unfair\nThe regulations implementing the ADA recognize additional time for taking the examination as one of the specific accommodations which should be made for bar applicants with a learning disability. After careful consideration, the Task Force on Disabled Applicants of the National Conference of Bar Examiners concluded that time and one-half to take the MBE was an appropriate accommodation for most applicants with learning disabilities. The Board's decision to deny Rubenstein additional time to take the MBE in 1993 is inconsistent with the recommendations of Rubenstein's expert, the ADA regulations, and the conclusions of the National Conference of Bar Examiners' Task Force on Disabled Applicants.\nThe fact that Rubenstein passed the MBE in 1992 without additional time, notwithstanding her then undiagnosed learning disability, did not constitute a rational basis for denying her additional time to take the MBE in 1993, after her learning disability became known. Although this Court recognizes the exemplary and professional manner in which the Board generally discharges its important responsibilities, the Board's decision to deny Rubenstein any additional time to take the MBE portion of the 1993 Bar Examination was not supported by the record. That decision was not the product of a logical deductive reasoning process and was manifestly unfair to Rubenstein.\n\nEquitable Remedy Rubenstein's Petition Granted\nHaving determined that the Board's decision to deny Rubenstein any additional time to take the MBE portion of the 1993 Bar Examination was manifestly unfair, this Court must consider an appropriate and equitable remedy. Since Rubenstein passed the essay portion of the Bar Examination in 1993, when her learning disability was properly accommodated with additional time to take that test, it would be inequitable to require her to take that section of Bar Examination again. If Rubenstein was permitted to retake only the MBE portion of the Bar Examination, with additional time, this Court would have to direct a waiver of the requirement that the essay and MBE sections both be passed in one sitting. B.R. 52.4(c). In re Hudson, Del.Supr., 402 A.2d 369, 371 (1979). The record reflects, however, that Rubenstein has already demonstrated her ability to pass the MBE section of the Bar Examination in a separate sitting, notwithstanding her disability, in 1992.\nThe Bar Examination tests for minimal competence to practice law. In re Reardon, Del.Supr., 378 A.2d 614, 617 (1977). Rubenstein has demonstrated her competence to practice law by passing both the essay section and the MBE section of the Bar Examination, albeit on separate occasions. See B.R. 52.4(c). Rubenstein's competence to practice law has also been attested to by the members of the Delaware Judiciary she practiced before pursuant to Rule 55, the Attorney General, and other members of the Delaware Bar who are familiar with her legal abilities. Accord Petition of Golby, Del. Supr., 375 A.2d 1049, 1050 (1977).\n*1140 The relief requested in Rubenstein's petition implicates Board Rule 52.4(c), which implements \"one aspect of this Court's exclusive right to govern the practice of law  the admission of persons to the Bar.\" Petition of Nenno, Del.Supr., 472 A.2d 815, 819 (1983). This Court alone is responsible for such matters. Id. We have concluded that, under the unique and limited circumstances here, Rubenstein's petition properly invokes this Court's inherent authority to suspend the requirement of Board Rule 52.4(c) that both sections of the Bar Examination be passed during one sitting.[7] Such action does not compromise either the integrity of the administration or the high standards of the Delaware Bar Examination. Compare In re Hudson, Del.Supr., 402 A.2d 369, 371 (1979); In re Fischer, Del.Supr., 425 A.2d 601, 602 (1980). Nor do we intend any criticism of the Board, which attempted in good faith to comply with the evolving standards of the ADA. Our ruling simply represents the correction of manifest unfairness under unusual circumstances involving an applicant who has exhausted every remedy available to her.\n\nConclusion\nUnder the facts and circumstances of Rubenstein's case, equitable principles of justice require that the manifest unfairness to Rubenstein be remedied by granting her application for relief from the Board's actions. Therefore, under this Court's exclusive authority with respect to applications for admission to the Delaware Bar, the simultaneous passage requirements of Board Rule 52.4(c) are waived. The Board is directed to deliver to Rubenstein the certificate required by Supreme Court Rule 52(e). The mandate shall issue forthwith.\n\n\n*1141 APPENDIX I\n\n*1142 \nNOTES\n[1]  The record reflects that the sole reason for the termination of Rubenstein's employment was her failure to pass the Bar Examination.\n[2]  The Board's decision to permit Rubenstein's application to take the Bar Examination for a fourth time was conditioned upon her acceptance of its decision to grant her additional time only with respect to the essay section. The record reflects that under the circumstances, Rubenstein had no alternative. Rubenstein had requested additional time to take the entire Bar Examination. When confronted with a Hobson's choice by the Board, Rubenstein's acquiescence cannot be fairly construed as a waiver of the right to contend that she should have been given additional time for the MBE.\n[3]  The Board does not dispute that Rubenstein is \"a person of good moral character and reputation,\" Supr.Ct.R. 52(a), or that she is qualified for admission to the Delaware Bar in every respect with the exception of her failure to pass both portions of the Bar Examination in one administration. B.R. 52.4(c).\n[4]  The Justice Department's analysis also states:\n\nSection 309 [42 U.S.C.A. § 12189] is intended to fill the gap that is created when licensing, certification, and other testing authorities are not covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act [29 U.S.C.A. § 794] (West Supp.1993) or title II of the ADA. Any such authority that is covered by section 504, because of the receipt of Federal money, or by title II, because it is a function of State or local government, must make all of its programs accessible to persons with disabilities, which includes physical access as well as modifications in the way the test is administered, e.g., extended time....\nId. (emphasis added).\n[5]  In D'Amico, the court pointed out that the ADA defines the term \"person\" as used in the examination and courses provision of Title III as having the same meaning given the term in Section 701 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 12111(7)). In the Civil Rights Act, \"person\" is defined as including governments and governmental agencies. Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a)).\n[6]  The position of the United States Department of Justice, stated in the ADA Handbook, is that the standards of Title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 will apply unless the ADA or its regulations explicitly adopts a different standard. ADA Handbook, II-11, III-12, Oct. 1991. See 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.103(a), 36.103(a) (1991). See also 42 U.S.C.A. § 1220(a) (\"[N]othing in this chapter shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the standards applied under Title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\").\n[7]  Nothing in this opinion should be construed as a repudiation of the reasonableness of the general requirement that both the essay and MBE portions of the examination should be passed at the same administration, particularly in order to prevent sequential concentration on one portion of the examination by \"locking away\" one portion of the examination in one year and concentration on the other portion in a following year. In re Hudson, Del.Supr., 402 A.2d 369, 371 (1979).\n"

        "text": "‘Govt. is also trying to improve revenues via sources such as PSU dividends’\n\nThe fact that the government is increasingly dependent on tax revenue, especially indirect taxes, to meet its fiscal requirements is not a cause for worry, according to tax analysts, who say that the real benefits of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have not yet taken effect. Once they do, government revenue from both direct and indirect taxes will grow significantly.\n\nAn analysis by The Hindu of the budget documents of the last five years has shown that the government’s dependence on tax revenue has steadily increased, with tax revenue making up a little more than 70% of its total receipts in 2018-19, up from 65% in 2014-15. Correspondingly, the share of revenue from non-tax sources (such as dividends from PSUs and the RBI) and capital receipts (such as disinvestment proceeds) has been declining.\n\nWithin tax revenue, the analysis shows that the share of indirect tax has been growing over the years, increasing to nearly 50% in 2018-19 from a little less than 45% in 2014-15. This increased dependence on tax revenue to meet its fiscal needs has meant that the government has had to push quite hard to increase its tax base at both the direct and indirect tax levels.\n\nThe view among tax analysts is that the government cannot take the risk of increasing tax rates, whether direct or indirect, for fear of a backlash from the public. So, the only option it has to boost tax revenues is to increase the tax base and stop evasion, both of which the government has been trying to do.\n\n“Several steps such as analysing the business-wise monthly GST payments and ascertaining trends in State-wise movement of goods using the e-waybill data would have already been initiated to evaluate options for enhancing the GST taxpayer database and revenues,” M.S. Mani, partner, Deloitte India, said.\n\n“Going forward, it is likely that the GST data would be correlated with information relevant from an income tax payment perspective so that incorrect tax filings can be corrected and revenues enhanced.\n\nDetecting tax evasion\n\n“Hence, the expansion of the GST taxpayer base, improving the return filings compliance and using the large amount of data available to detect tax evasion would become the cornerstone of the government’s measures to enhance tax revenues,” Mr. Mani added.\n\nThe other trend the government would be banking on is that increased economic activity and a higher GDP growth rate will boost consumption and hence, indirect tax collections, other analysts say.\n\n“The indirect tax rate is fixed, so if there is price inflation, then the government receives a tax on that as well because product prices go up and so the tax component also goes up,” Ranen Banerjee, partner, PwC India, said. “The second aspect is that when the GDP grows, consumption also grows, and so you get more indirect taxes from that.”\n\nEfficiency gains\n\n“The efficiency gains of GST haven’t yet kicked in and once they do, this will give revenue buoyancy in the next 3-5 years,” Mr. Banerjee added.\n\nHowever, he said that the worry for the government should be the fact that an increasing proportion of its indirect tax collections are coming from a single source — oil.\n\nNon-tax revenue\n\nDespite this optimistic outlook of future growth in tax revenue, the government has also been trying to improve its collections from other sources such as dividends from public sector companies and the Reserve Bank of India, and also through disinvestments.\n\nThe analysis of budget data shows that PSU dividends as a proportion of non-tax revenue have been growing over the years, from 16% in 2014-15 to 21.4% in 2018-19. The government has reportedly been pressurising the state-run oil companies to transfer larger dividends to the Centre every year.\n\nIt is also reportedly asking the state-run oil companies to buy back shares, and is also pushing more PSUs to list on the stock exchanges.\n\nHowever, this is an untenable source of revenue for the government because they are based on finite resources.\n\nNotably, dividends from the RBI, as a proportion of non-tax revenue, have been falling.\n\n“Non-tax revenues, if you look at the majority, they have come from auctioning spectrum licences and royalties from oil, etc, and also disinvestment,” Mr. Banerjee said.\n\n“All of these have a limit. Suppose you decide to sell everything, but after that, what? You cannot expand your budget based on this,” he said."

Osmium impregnation leached the ground matrix of the parasite thereby displaying a system of intermediate-sized filaments. Because microtubules are only present as part of the mitotic spindle and as remnants of the sporozoite cytoskeleton, the observed intermediate-sized filaments comprise most of the cytoskeletal organization of the liver stage malaria parasite."

        "text": "On or about 815am on Wednesday morning, May 9, 2013, I approached the tram with my daughter as we do each morning as I take her to preschool in Manhattan as I go to work. That morning, like many mornings, there was no attendant stationed at the booth to open the security gate for parents who have young children with strollers.\n\nThat morning, there was a female Public Safety Officer stationed in the booth.... I swiped my card and I asked the Officer if she would open the gate so I could enter with the stroller. My daughter wanted to go in to be with her friends who were waiting for the tram with their mother and she also wanted me to come with her.\n\nThe Officer said it was not her job to open the gate. I then asked her if she would contact someone who would and she refused to do that. Meanwhile my daughter was getting anxious to enter to be with her friends and asking me to come.\n\nI told the Officer that other Public Safety Officers open the gate when the tram employees are not around but she still refused and became very un professional and hostile towards me. My daughter started to cry and panic reacting to the Officer’s un professional conduct and temper.\n\nFinally the tram came and the operator opened the gate but the Officer continued her hostility towards me and my poor daughter cried all the way over on the tram. The Officer blamed me for causing my daughter to cry when in fact it was her misconduct which created the situation. Public Safety is to assist the public. It is not their job to treat us like thugs or criminals but to help us.\n\nA few months ago on behalf of the Roosevelt Island Parents Network and the RIRA Island Services Committee I brought up the problem of the access to the Tram boarding area for parents with strollers, which also affects people in wheelchairs and bikers.\n\nParents with strollers have to wait until someone from the Tram personnel, usually the Tram conductor, comes to open the gate for them. While the cabins are not in the station, all other passengers can go through the turnstiles and pre-load. Especially during long winter months like this year, this can affect the health of the residents and their babies. For example, mothers who just gave birth and their newborns have to wait in the cold in front of the gate and cannot get to the heaters of the pre-boarding area. But even in warmer times, the current situation is unfair and affects timing: Especially in rush hour a parent or another care-giver can miss the Tram even though she or he was the first one at the station – but had to wait for the gate to be opened while everybody else pre-loaded – causing the parent to be late for work or another appointment.\n\nWe suggested a number of solutions to RIOC and we are very pleased to have received a positive progress report last week by RIOCʼs Community Relations Specialist Erica Spencer-El. As a short-term solution, an additional staffer has been assigned who should now assist with opening the gate during rush hours. Unfortunately there is still feed-back from parents that this is not always the case. In the long run the plan is to hire an extra person designated to opening the gate and supervising the whole area permanently. We hope this can happen as soon as possible. On behalf of the many parents who live on Roosevelt Island or visit it, as well as the wheelchair- users and bikers we would like to thank RIOC for the progress already made and for further acting on this issue!\n\nThe issue of Baby Stroller access to the Roosevelt Island Tram entrance gate\n\nWritten by Kim Esop-Wylie and Directed by Mihaela Mihut and Cornelius Horgan, Mythery & Mayhem is set in ancient Greece. According to MST&DA:\n\nTo humans 3000 years ago the world was a strange and mystical place. What is lightening? Why are there seasons? Where does fire come from?

The Cornell NYC Tech ULURP application will now proceed to the full NYC Council and Mayor Bloomberg for expected approval. However, even after final approval from NYC, Cornell NYC Tech still needs to negotiate and come to an agreement with the Roosevelt Island Operating Corp (RIOC) for the approximately 3 acres of land controlled by RIOC within the planned Cornell NYC Tech campus on the site of the current Goldwater Hospital....\n\nThis morning, Ms Lappin, NYC Council Speaker and Mayoral Candidate Christine Quinn, Cornell NYC Tech Vice President Cathy Dove, Cornell Dean Dan Huttenlocher, Roosevelt Island Community Coalition (RICC) Co-Chairs Ellen Polivy and Jonathan Kalkin as well as Roosevelt Island resident and Community Board 8 Member Larry Parnes appeared at a Press Conference to announce the vote to approve Cornell NYC Tech coming to Roosevelt Island and to congratulate each other on working together to bring the project to this stage of the process.\n\nfollowed by questions about barging construction materials, ferry service, ongoing negotiations with the Roosevelt Island Operating Corp (RIOC) for land controlled by RIOC, financial contributions to Roosevelt Island by NYC and more.\n\nClick here for theLetter Agreement detailing the commitments made by Cornell NYC Tech to City Council Member Jessica Lappin, the entire City Council and the Roosevelt Island Community which are included as part of the lease agreement between the NYC and Cornell for the Goldwater Hospital site. In addition to the commitments included in the lease agreement, NYC Deputy Mayor’s Robert Steel sent this letter dated May 2 2012 to Ms. Lappin regarding NYC contributing operating funds for a pilot Roosevelt Island ferry service and NYPD monitoring security concerns for the new campus.\n\nHere's the Press Release from Ms. Lappin's office:\n\nToday, City Council Member Jessica Lappin, Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, Cornell NYC Tech Vice President Cathy Dove, Cornell NYC Tech Dean Dan Huttenlocher, and Roosevelt Island community members announced that the City Council will vote to approve the Cornell NYC Tech campus on Roosevelt Island.\n\n“Cornell NYC Tech is about the future of New York—it will drive innovation and economic growth for generations to come. When this idea was first proposed, I formed a community coalition to champion building the campus in Manhattan, and specifically Roosevelt Island. The new school will be a tremendous boon, not only for my City Council district, but for the entire Big Apple,” said Council Member Jessica Lappin, whose district includes Roosevelt Island.\n\nToday’s City Council vote is the final step in the city’s land use review process for Cornell NYC Tech, two million-square-foot applied sciences and engineering campus that will be located at the Goldwater Hospital site on Roosevelt Island in Manhattan. The project is expected to have a $33 billion economic impact, creating 48,000 new jobs and 1,000 spin-off companies over the next three decades.[1]\n\nCouncil Member Jessica Lappin negotiated to secure many commitments from the Administration and Cornell NYC Tech. The city has pledged to contribute funding to a one-year summer ferry service pilot program and has designated an NYPD liaison to ensure continued safety and security on Roosevelt Island. The university has committed to:\n\n· Undertake the most aggressive voluntary use of barging in New York City, which will reduce the number of construction vehicles on Roosevelt Island by more than half, as compared to traditional building techniques.\n\n· Partner with New York City middle schools to create Science, Technology, Education, and Mathematics (STEM) programs, with a special focus on girls. Initial pilot programs will begin at P.S./I.S. 217 on Roosevelt Island, M.S. 406 in East Harlem, and I.S. 204 and P.S. 111 in Long Island City, Queens. Starting this summer, Cornell NYC Tech will sponsor an immersion program for girls in these schools to learn coding, web design, robotics and mobile development under the mentorship of some of the industry’s top engineers and entrepreneurs.\n\n· \"Adopt\" the local school on Roosevelt Island, PS/IS 217, by providing programming such as teacher training and support, after school programming, tech events, career day options, and hardware and software programming development.\n\n· Conduct air monitoring throughout the project, including demolition, excavation and construction. The results of this monitoring will be posted on the construction website.\n\n· Engage extensively with the Roosevelt Island community by creating a construction task force with residents and others; researching ways that technology can enhance the lives of the disabled and the older adults on the Island; providing computers and training to senior center members and the disabled community; providing a tech fair to advance technology education for the disabled; working with the community to program outdoor space for children.\n\nSpeaker Christine C. Quinn said “Cornell NYC Tech is a win for the City of New York, Roosevelt Island community and our local economy. This campus will help New York City continue to attract more of the brightest minds, which in turn, will attract more of the best businesses. The City Council is proud to approve the final steps necessary for construction to commence, and we look forward to the completion of this new state-of-the-art campus.”\n\nCathy Dove, Vice President, Cornell NYC Tech said “We are extremely grateful for the leadership of Council Member Lappin and Speaker Quinn, for the support of the City Council, and for Mayor Bloomberg's vision. We worked throughout the public review process to incorporate input from the community into our approach– that input has resulted in a stronger campus plan. We are confident the result is a Cornell Tech campus we can all be proud of and that will benefit both the Roosevelt Island community and the entire city. We look forward to breaking ground next year and continuing to work closely with the community as our campus develops.”\n\nEllen Polivy, Co-Chair of the Roosevelt Island Community Coalition (RICC) said “Council Member Lappin did an amazing job fighting for us. Cornell NYC Tech’s “adoption” of our local school was much appreciated by everybody. I want to thank Cornell for all their work to plan for the future, and we look forward to a successful partnership going forward.”\n\nJonathan Kalkin, Co-Chair of Roosevelt Island Community Coalition (RICC) said “It’s been exciting to work with Council Member Lappin and Cornell. Cornell NYC Tech will be a game changer for Roosevelt Island and for New York City. We can’t wait to see what innovations will come from the school, and we look forward to greeting our new neighbors.”\n\nThe goslings hatched!

What happened to Please marvel at this miracle of nature? (Look closely in the 3rd picture to see just that).\n\nImages From Denise Shull\n\nThe FDR Park barricade sign says:\n\nPlease excuse our temporary barricades.\n\nA mother Canada goose is currently nesting under one of our Littleleaf Linden Trees. The father Canada goose is protecting the nest and can be very aggressive.\n\nTo protect both the goose family and our visitors we have barricaded the nest until the eggs hatch. Please respect the barricades and follow the directions of Four Freedoms Park Rangers during this time.\n\nDogs can be in strollers but not babies Incredible!! RIOC allows dogs in strollers to ride the Red Bus (and they sure can walk), but they make parents close the strollers and carry their babies during rush hours.... So now dogs have more rights than persons?\n\nHand baggage, instrument cases, bundles and parcels may be carried onto RIOC buses by customers provided that these articles can be carried on without inconveniencing other customers and/or the driver and does not obstruct the bus aisle or doors. Persons with unfolded strollers and/or shopping carts are not permitted to board RIOC buses unless the driver, at his or her sole discretion, determines that it will not cause an inconvenience or safety hazard to other customers or the driver. Orthopedic (wheelchair type) strollers for children with disabilities are permitted on buses just as wheelchairs are and must be secured in the wheelchair area. Bus operators must check strollers carefully to ensure that children with disabilities are not denied accessible service.\n\nUpdated signage has been posted on buses stating:\n\n\"Strollers and Shopping Carts must be folded upon operator’s request\".\n\nPLEASE TAKE NOTICE that a meeting of the Real Estate Development Advisory Committee of the RIOC Board of Directors will be held on Monday, May 6, 2013 at 5:30 p.m. at the RIOC administrative office, 591 Main Street, Roosevelt Island, New York.\n\nThe NYC Council Land Use Committee approved the Roosevelt Island Cornell NYC Tech ULURP application last Thursday May 2. The Cornell NYC Tech ULURP application will now proceed to the full NYC Council and Mayor Bloomberg for expected approval.

        "text": "Monday, June 23, 2014\n\nWhat a wonderful Idea it was for the US and UK to remove Saddam - The map shows the consequences\n\nJihadist fighters in Iraq seized three border crossings into Syria and Jordan and four nearby towns over the weekend, giving the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) control over much of the country's western frontier and directly threatening the country's main power supply.\n\nIsis can now add large swaths of the Iraqi border to a 300km stretch of land it already controls along the Euphrates river, from Mosul in the north to Saddam Hussein's home town, Tikrit, which now gives the group a launching pad for potential attacks on strategic sites, including the lifeblood of Iraq's electricity generation, the Haditha dam. The gains also bring the crisis in Iraq to the doorstep of Jordan, a key ally of the United States.\n\nThe latest Isis offensive comes as Iraq’s polarised political blocs face a week of intense lobbying to form an inclusive government that could unite the fracturing country.\n\nThe US secretary of state, John Kerry, is in Baghdad.\n\nThe latest Isis offensive in western Anbar province has seen the group take four towns in recent days.\n\nIraqi officials said the militants took over the Turaibil crossing with Jordan and the Walid crossing with Syria after government forces there pulled out.\n\nAl-Qaim, a restive town on the Syrian border, fell a day earlier.\n\nThe capture of the crossings follows the fall on Friday and Saturday of the towns of Rawah, Anah and Rutba. They are all in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province, where the militants have since January controlled the city of Falluja and parts of the provincial capital, Ramadi.\n\nThe rank is sergeant. Sargent was quite a fine painter. I am surprised that, you, with your deep military connections didn’t know the difference. Sort of a “Corpseman” problem I suppose. I did take the OTS test, but they rejected me because I was too smart to become an officer.\n\nSunni militants have blitzed through the vast desert of western Iraq, capturing four towns and two border crossings and deepening the predicament of the Shi'ite-led government in Baghdad led by Nouri al-Maliki.The latest military victories - including two border posts captured yesterday, one along the frontier with Jordan and the other with Syria - considerably expanded territory under control by ISIS just two weeks after the Al Qaeda-inspired group began swallowing up chunks of northern Iraq.The lightening offensive by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) takes the group closer to its dream of carving out an Islamic state straddling both Syria and Iraq.Moreover, controlling the borders with Syria will help it supply fellow fighters there with weaponry looted from Iraqi warehouses, significantly reinforcing its ability to battle beleaguered Syrian government forces.It came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry landed in Baghdad today on a surprise trip to push for Iraqi unity and stability.Flying in from Jordan on a visit which the State Department had sought to keep secret amid security concerns, Kerry was to meet with beleaguered Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Iraqi leaders across the political and communal spectrum.\n\n... Moreover, controlling the borders with Syria will help it supply fellow fighters there with weaponry looted from Iraqi warehouses, significantly reinforcing its ability to battle beleaguered Syrian government forces.\n\nIsrael thinks it’s a good idea to further weaken Syria? Why, so their ground forces can face ISIS, with US weapons, in Jordan?\n\nMubarak, Saddam and Assad, all kept the Islamists under control. Your Neocon friends, the Israilis and our best friends the Saudis, fixed all that. The folly is unraveling a city at a time. the numbers of “”foreign” fighters is estimated at 10,000. I wonder how difficult it will be for them to get their hands on a nuclear weapon?\n\nDeuce ☂Mon Jun 23, 05:29:00 AM EDTMubarak, Saddam and Assad, all kept the Islamists under control. Your Neocon friends, the Israilis and our best friends the Saudis, fixed all that. The folly is unraveling a city at a time. the numbers of “”foreign” fighters is estimated at 10,000. I wonder how difficult it will be for them to get their hands on a nuclear weapon?\n\nSo you like mass murderers like Saddam and Assad? Mubarak did keep control and wasn't a great guy but not the mass murderer like Assad and Saddam.\n\nAs for your number of 10,000 foreign fighters? Latest reports there were about 2,000 european jihadists (moths to the flame) and several thousand other arabs. The rest, the infrastructure? Baathists. Saddamists.\n\nBut a force of 10k? Out of a population of MILLIONS?\n\nLOL\n\nFact is that the ISIS suck and are the new and improved sunni saddamists/baathists/jihadists.\n\nIran, with it's ied's in iras, support of syria and hezbollah, it's brutal murder of it's arabs, the brutal repression of it's kurds and others is now about to get the blow back it deserves.\n\nLook to NUMEROUS uprisings in Iran now. Arabs in the south, being starved of water are pissed. Secular Iranians? Will continue to hide and flee. There are over 50 different ethnic groups in Iran, in fact over 55% of Iran is NON-persian.\n\nIt's going to be a hot summer...\n\nHigher gas prices\n\nAnd of course islamists killing islamists.... by the dozens of scores on a monthly basis.\n\nSince the Rosenbergs gave the Soviets US nuclear secrets, the Soviet Union produced approximately 55,000 nuclear warheads. They are not all accounted for and neither are the components to build them. ISIS will have nuclear weapons. Anything is for sale. It is reported that ISIS now has over $2 billion in cash and gold.\n\nIsrael was delighted along with the Saudis when civil war broke out in Syria. Israel even joined in air attacks. It was a collosal error.\n\nISIS is smart enough to recognize that the only thing that Israel has is a nuclear deterrent. ISIS will not be defeated by the Iraqis. ISIS will border Israel. You will have two religious states, sise by side. I fear that ISIS is here to stay.\n\nISIS has come out of the Syrian conflict and won the “hearts and minds” of a lot of highly motivated Muslim youth. Many are very, very smart. Israel will the rue the day they got what they wished for in Syria and Iraq.\n\nYep, with the Zionists now in control of the Ukraine, the ante has been upped.\n\nWhile the Russians are essentially weaker than the US, they have capacity in a number of areas. The US cannot match them nuke for nuke. The US cannot match them tank for tank, in the Ukraine or in Poland. The US has no military option to play against Russia. So if a stray nuke, from the Ukrainian stockpile were to have found its way to the Euphrates valley, why, my oh my.\n\nJack HawkinsMon Jun 23, 09:00:00 AM EDTYep, with the Zionists now in control of the Ukraine, the ante has been upped.\n\nWhile the Russians are essentially weaker than the US, they have capacity in a number of areas.

So if a stray nuke, from the Ukrainian stockpile were to have found its way to the Euphrates valley, why, my oh my.\n\nBy not moving expeditiously against the weapons that the ISIS garnered in Mosul, the target has now dispersed. In the days that have gone by, that equipment has been moved, not towards Baghdad, but to the Euphrates valley.\n\nNow we have round two of \"The Great SCUD Hunt\", but on a grander scale. It will not be a replay of Stormn' Norman's crushing of Saddam's conventional forces in Kuwait. It won't be \"Shock and Awe\", but more like the Israel's failure in Lebanon. where they ran numerous air ops, bombing the same piece of Beirut, over and over, because there were no 'targets of opportunity'. Yet the missiles fell relentlessly upon Haifa.\n\nThe Israeli have gotten their cake. Their \"Yinon Plan\" is well developed, the countries around them are fragmenting, all according to their program. With every civilian killed or kidnapped, the Israeli strike out blindly against the easiest target, even when those targeted strikes give sustenance to the killers and kidnappers.\n\nSyria murders 160 thousand men women and kids, make up to 6 million refugees (real ones not like the palestinians) mostly sunni folks.Iran and Hezbollah (and russian equipment assistance) rush in with advisors and in Hezbollah's case, troops.\n\nthis now spills over and the Sunnis, which is pissed about Iran, Hezbollah and Syria AND IRAQ take the battle to Iraq as well.\n\nIsis and others will be creating a new Islamist state from Jordan to southern Iran. Kudistan is carving out it's place.\n\nSomeone posited that Jordan would have to enter a mutual defense treaty with Israel or become another bloody battlefield. I wonder what ruminations are passing through the mind of Abdullah II as he picks at his lunch, today?\n\nAs to the prowess of the IDF when facing the ISIS in battle, I think you know the answer. If you do have doubts, you may get your answer before too long. When the IDF smashes the ISIS like a bug, I wager the UN will be badmouthing the IDF within less than 24 hours, demanding proportionality, return of territory pacified, and an immediate halt to fighting.\n\nMr. Kerry will be on a plane to Tel Aviv faster than a blackbird on a June bug. Israel should insist that he drive up to the new Israeli Embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nWhen the IDF smashes the ISIS like a bug, I wager the UN will be badmouthing the IDF within less than 24 hours, demanding proportionality, return of territory pacified, and an immediate halt to fighting.\n\nAre you sure they're up to it? Seem to have had a spot of trouble in Lebanon, 2006. Reminded me of Jellico in the battle of Jutland when two of His Majesty's ships went down in short order. \"There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today.\"\n\nDespite his shrewdness, Nasrallah has been a compulsive gambler for whom only one step separates success from catastrophe. For many years, he won, but in the summer of 2006, his winning streak was broken. First, he kidnapped two Israeli soldiers, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, sparking war with Israel; second, he chose after that war to challenge the Lebanese government of Fouad Siniora, plunging Lebanon into a long crisis and Hezbollah into the murky waters of Lebanese politics.\n\nNasrallah's gambles have transformed Hezbollah's identity and standing. The group gained the respect of many Lebanese, Arabs, and Muslims as it acquired the sheen of victory as a resistance movement. Now, however dominant Hezbollah is, it is developing into just another Lebanese political party, corrupted by its participation in day-to-day politics. Yet inside Lebanon, its record includes the terrible destruction it brought on the country through its unilateral actions. Worse, it is viewed increasingly as a narrowly-focused Shi‘i force serving as a tool, if not a fifth column, of Iran with the aim of advancing a host of Iranian interests—inside Lebanon, against Israel, and across the Sunni divide.[4]\n\nTwo years after Hezbollah's war with Israel, Lebanon is a divided country teetering on the verge of a civil war that is largely a result of Hezbollah's bellicosity toward Israel and its refusal to submit itself to the domain of politics with the rest of Lebanon. Hezbollah itself is a battered and bruised organization struggling to regain its standing inside Lebanon.\n\nMeanwhile, two other realities are indisputable: First, since the 2006 war, quiet has prevailed along the Israeli-Lebanese border such as has not been known there since the late 1960s, prior to the arrival of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) forces in Lebanon. This quiet derives above all from Hezbollah's wariness of Israel. The organization is concerned that it and its supporters will not be able to withstand the strain of a new round of fighting. The second reality is Nasrallah's disappearance from public events. Prior to the 2006 war, it was customary for him to participate monthly in more than dozen meetings. For example, in October and November 2005, Al-Manar television and the Lebanese National News Agency reported twenty-eight public meetings, speeches, or media events. His need to remain hidden is a blow to someone who depends on frequent public exposure, and it reinforces the perception of Hezbollah's vulnerability to assassination and sabotage. Indeed, rumors are rife of Iranian dissatisfaction with Nasrallah. On the eve of Mughniyeh's assassination, reports circulated that Tehran had supplanted Nasrallah's leadership with his deputy leader Na‘im Qasim.[5] While both Nasrallah and Qasim denied the reports,[6] Iranian disappointment with Nasrallah's conduct during and after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and its belief that Nasrallah endangered Iranian interests by his uncalculated behavior has been evident in many reports in both the Lebanese and Arab media.[7]\n\nOn the morning of July 12, 2006, Hezbollah fighters attacked an IDF patrol moving along the Israeli-Lebanese border. Nasrallah later admitted that he had thought at the time that the Israeli response would be minor, localized, and limited, like past Israeli reactions to similar Hezbollah provocations.[10] Instead, the government of Israel launched an all-out war against Hezbollah.\n\nThe war lasted thirty-three days and brought ruin and destruction not witnessed since the end of the Lebanese civil war (1975-90) on the Lebanese side of the border, from the towns and villages in the south to the Shi‘i suburbs of Beirut. The fighting killed close to 1,300 Lebanese civilians, together with perhaps 600 Hezbollah fighters. Nearly a million Lebanese became refugees, including most of the Shi‘i population of southern Lebanon.[11]\n\nAs the war ended, Nasrallah declared that Hezbollah had won a \"divine victory.\"[12] After all, Hezbollah had survived the Israeli assault and had quite a few successes in the fighting such as striking Haifa for the first time since 1948,[13] as well as hitting the Israeli military vessel, Hanit, off the Beirut shore on the evening of July 14, 2006.[14] However, the gains did not outnumber the losses. Hezbollah suffered severe blows during the fighting, hence Nasrallah's admission that if he realized there was even a one percent chance of a sustained military response from Israel, he would not have given orders to kidnap the Israeli soldiers.[15]\n\nhence Nasrallah's admission that if he realized there was even a one percent chance of a sustained military response from Israel, he would not have given orders to kidnap the Israeli soldiers.\n\n[18] Despite such a result, Lebanese Shi‘a had no choice but to rally around Nasrallah. There was no one else in Lebanon let alone at the U.N. or in the international community who cared about them. Communal Lebanese government leaders focused on the interests of the Sunni, Maronite, and Druze communities even though these communities barely suffered in the war. However, the damage inflicted on the Shi‘a clearly reduced Nasrallah's room for maneuver, as evidenced by his admission at the end of the war.[19]\n\nAs the weeks and months passed, the degree of damage inflicted on the organization's military power also became clear. It was just as painful and significant as the damage done to the organization's political power. First, Israeli forces destroyed Hezbollah's stockpile of strategic missiles, primarily Zilzal unguided rockets from Iran, during the first moments of the Israeli attack on the night of July 12, 2007. Nasrallah had hoped to use these missiles against central Israel. This was a severe blow to the Hezbollah leader, who lost an important bargaining chip even before the campaign began. Indeed, the precision of Israeli intelligence, which enabled Jerusalem to strike at the organization's strategic stockpile, surprised Nasrallah.[20]\n\nSecond, Israeli assessments estimate that Hezbollah lost about a third of its elite fighting force. While Hezbollah has no difficulty attracting volunteers to its ranks, turning them into skilled military operators is a lengthy and complex process.[21] Third, despite the mistakes made by the IDF in conducting the military campaign, Israeli soldiers triumphed in every face-to-face battle with Hezbollah.[22]\n\nNasrallah concealed these facts from the Lebanese people and perhaps even from Iran. Hezbollah fed reports of successes and victories to both audiences.[23] Despite the false reports, however, Tehran likely realized the scope of disaster Hezbollah had suffered, and there is no doubt that Nasrallah himself grasped the extent of the damage that had been done to his organization and himself.\n\nIn the wake of the 2006 war, the following facts have become clear: First, Hezbollah, which represented itself as the \"defender of Lebanon,\" turned out to be its destroyer, due to the extensive devastation it brought down on the heads of the Lebanese people in the course of the war. Second, Hezbollah's deterrent charm was dispelled. The war made it clear that the organization could no longer carry out military operations against Israel along the Lebanese-Israeli border and expect Israel to refrain from retaliating. Third, Hezbollah was perceived more and more as a Shi‘i organization serving Iranian interests.\n\nThus, there is nothing surprising in the fact that since the war, Nasrallah has devoted himself to repairing and rebuilding his power while, at the same time, taking greater care than ever before to preserve the quiet along the Lebanese-Israeli border. He has no desire to rekindle the confrontation with Israel until his position in Lebanon has improved.\n\nThe Galloway comments were from April, McCain was standing with the Ukrainian Nazis in that time period, the Israeli were speaking of funding an exodus from the Ukraine.\n\nLo and behold, after the coup Mr Petro Poroshenko is elected and the leader of the \"Right Sector\" Sashko Muzychko was murdered.The Israeli announce that with the election of Mr Poroshenko, they will not fund the exodus program from Ukraine.\n\nToday, there are 50,000,000 refugees, as many as from WWII. This horrifying fact and the equally horrifying fact that Islam is responsible for most of the misery gets about 1/1000th the news coverage of an Israeli soldier kicking some stone chucking punk squarely in the ass.\n\nHe calls his troops “the Blue Helmets of Maidan,” but brown is the color of the headgear worn by Delta — the nom de guerre of the commander of a Jewish-led militia force that participated in the Ukrainian revolution. Under his helmet, he also wears a kippah.\n\nDelta, a Ukraine-born former soldier in the Israel Defense Forces, spoke to JTA Thursday on condition of anonymity. He explained how he came to use combat skills he acquired in the Shu’alei Shimshon reconnaissance battalion of the Givati infantry brigade to rise through the ranks of Kiev’s street fighters. He has headed a force of 40 men and women — including several fellow IDF veterans — in violent clashes with government forces.\n\nSeveral Ukrainian Jews, including Rabbi Moshe Azman, one of the country’s claimants to the title of chief rabbi, confirmed Delta’s identity and role in the still-unfinished revolution.\n\nIn disproportionate retaliation for the murder of an Israeli teenager in the Golan, yesterday, the IAF put some major hurt on the Syrian Army, this morning. Both Syria and Hezbollah are bitterly crying out to various peace organizations concerning the Zionist aggression. Naturally, it is unconfirmed that PM Netanyahu replied, לפוצץ אותי.\n\nJack HawkinsMon Jun 23, 12:10:00 PM EDTThose ISIS fellas are smarter than the average Muslims.allen was correct when he made that observation some days ago.\n\nDas Allen made no such observation.\n\nDas Allen made the observation that as a culture (aggregate having a mean) Jews have higher IQs than the world's other cultures.

Can you imagine a group of randomly chosen private citizens rewriting the U.S. constitution to include measures banning corporate fraud? It seems incomprehensible in the U.S., but Icelanders did just that. Icelanders forced their entire government to resign after a banking fraud scandal, overthrowing the ruling party and creating a citizen’s group tasked with writing a new constitution that offered a solution to prevent corporate greed from destroying the country. The constitution of Iceland was scrapped and is being rewritten by private citizens; using a crowd-sourcing technique via social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter. These events have been going on since 2008, yet there’s been no word from the U.S. mainstream media about any of them. In fact, all of the events that unfolded were recorded by international journalists, overseas news bureaus, citizen journalists and bloggers. This has created current accusations of an intentional cover up of the story by mainstream U.S. news sources.\n\nAn “iReport” on CNN, written by a private citizen in May 2012, has questioned the reasons why this revolution has not been widely covered in the U.S., suggesting that perhaps the mainstream media is controlled by large corporate interests and thus has been unwilling to report on Iceland’s activities.\n\nRead more athttp://guardianlv.com/2013/12/icelanders-overthrow-government-and-rewrite-constitution-after-banking-fraud-no-word-from-us-media/#ruBMWB8C6orqGzhV.9\n\nJust because Leslie Moonves, Michael Eisner, Rubert Murdock and Brian L.

I would merely observe that\n\n1. In talking average IQ's one has to remember it is just that, an average. When we look at the average IQ for the Swedes, it becomes painfully obvious that Bob, like one or two others here, is ensconced comfortably in the low end of the bell curve.\n\n2. Were Israel to fight ISIS, IMO it would be a great thing. Will it happen? Unless ISIS initiates a conflict, I would doubt it. I agree with Deuce on motivations.\n\n3. WRT Jordan. The ISIS blitzkrieg has employed conventional war tactics in Iraq even though they operate out of little clown cars and the backs of pick-up trucks. While it worked in Syria which was already torn by civil war and Iraq which was torn by sectarian strife and was burdened by an army in name only, were they to attack Jordan in the same manner they would be quickly thwarted by Jordan's air force. The same would apply to Iran. I would think that if they attack Jordan it will be through terror and other asymmetric means. Probably the biggest threat Jordan has remains is its refugee problem and the tens of thousands of it has taken in.\n\nallenMon Jun 23, 01:15:00 PM EDTJack HawkinsMon Jun 23, 12:10:00 PM EDTThose ISIS fellas are smarter than the average Muslims.allen was correct when he made that observation some days ago.\n\nDas Allen made no such observation.\n\nDas Allen made the observation that as a culture (aggregate having a mean) Jews have higher IQs than the world's other cultures.

Jews are scattered around the globe. The Jewish population probably includes every race. Do you measure by religion, ethnicity, race? What culture are you measuring, the US, Israel?\n\nThe largest concentration and recently the largest population of Jews is in Israel.

I do not take it personally.\n\nMore nonsense.\n\nNo one complained about your 'critique' of Christian beliefs. What was complained about was your methods and the manner of presentation.\n\nJews find all those things amusing but simple minded, as IQ tests bear out. Indeed, some linguists posit that the very word Christian derives from the root word for \"cretin\" (Frankish), which means retarded (more or less). Oh, we Jews also think it is a good idea to know the language before translating the book or making moronic commentaries on its content, meaning, and implications.\n\nThe same arguments could have come from the Nazis in talking of the Jews or the Gypsies. Denigrate them. Give the eugenics argument. Use lies (IQ, what a joke). Misrepresent (offer an incomplete and misrepresented etymology). The \"Das Allen' you used seems strangely apropos.\n\nEven more telling is your use of \"Jews find...\" and \"We Jews...\" as if your 'master race' theories represent the totality of Jewish thought. Were that true, and if the Jews had the numbers and the power and based on other comments you have made here I suspect we might have seen a similar holocaust perpetrated by you and those that believe as you do.\n\nMagnificent Ronald and the Founding Fathers of al Qaeda\n\n“These gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s founding fathers.” — Ronald Reagan while introducing the Mujahideen leaders to media on the White house lawns (1985).

Do not inundate students with too much information at one time. Start off teaching by assuming that the student knows absolutely nothing about drums. As lessons progress, the complexity of the jargon and practices can progress as well.\n\nEncourage the right equipment - A teacher should encourage students to take good care of their drums. A double tom case will save a student time because he will have less that he needs to carry around. Likewise, a portable handcart is a nice item to have. This can help a person move the drums from the vehicle to the stage without injuring himself from trying to carry the equipment.\n\nEncourage over learning - A student on a drum must know every piece of that set and every sound that the set makes so that it is simply second nature when he plays it. Every lick should be over learned so that playing the drum is done without even needing to think about it.\n\nHelp with cleaning - A good teacher will help his students not only be able to play the drum sets, but will also help a student know how to care for the equipment. Teachers can show students how to clean their sets by using a can of compressed air to get the dust out of the places that are hard to reach with a rag. Such places include areas such as in between the lugs and underneath the foot pedals.\n\nDrums also often have dry duct tape residue on them. If there is residue on either the cymbals or on the drum stands, it can fairly easily be removed with a bottle of \"Goo Gone.\"\n\nPractice without drums - Even though a set is needed for performing, it is not always needed for practicing. A person who is working on learning a beat sometimes might be better off starting without the drums and then start using the set once he has become a little more comfortable with the lick that is to be played.\n\nEncourage \"heel up\" play - Teaching a student about a technique to use when playing a drum set can make the student improve at a faster pace. It can also keep him from getting used to bad habits. By using the heel up method for playing a bass drum, a teacher can help his student know how to play with more power and more speed.\n\nPlay together - Playing a drum set alongside a student can help the student get a better idea of the positioning and posture he needs to have to play well. Playing together can also help a student better learn how to keep a beat on these sets.\n\nA teacher who takes the time to properly explain and show his student how to play on drum sets is likely to increase his customer base thanks to the good reviews he will receive."

        "text": "The gene polymorphism of LOX1 predicts the incidence of LVH in patients with essential hypertension.\nLectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) has been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling under different pathologic conditions. The role of genetic polymorphisms in the LOX1 gene, however, remains unclear in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) for patients with hypertension. A total of 536 patients diagnosed with essential hypertension (EH) were recruited in this study. Patients were assigned to the LVH+ (n=143) and LVH- (n=393) groups, respectively. The serum LOX1 level was measured and three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e. intron 4 (G→A), intron 5(T→G), and 3' UTR (T→C) of the LOX1 gene were genotyped. The genotype frequencies of intron 4 G>A and 3'UTR T>C were not significantly different between the LVH+ and LVH- groups (both P>0.05), however, frequencies of 501G>C were significantly different between those two groups (P=0.007). The 501CC genotype carriers had a markedly higher serum LOX1 level and an increased risk to develop LVH (adjusted OR=2.444, adjusted P=0.002). There was a positive correlation between serum LOX1 level and left ventricular mass index (r=0.907, P<0.001); a cutoff value of 1.0 ng/mL for sLOX-1 was applied to significantly differentiate the LVH+ patients from the LVH- patients with 84% sensitivity and 86% specificity. Our data suggest that both the 501>C SNP in the LOX1 gene and the serum LOX1 level may be used to predict the development of LVH among EH patients."

My husband always told me to count sheep and I told him where to stick his sheep! He can fall asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow so he has no clue what insomnia is like. It’s weird because I use to need total darkness and quiet but baby needs a sound machine to sleep and I feel like sometimes that helps tune everything out. But other times I’m still staring at the ceiling - I try to make sure to put any electronic devices out of the way because that can make your mind not want to shut off. I wish there was a magic tea for us all to drink.\n\nYes! I've been on sleeping meds for insomnia for 17 years.

        "text": "So . . . I saw the rheumatologist yesterday and he said he is confused . . . basically my blood work indicates SLE, Sjogrens and other connective tissue disorders, but no positive ANA (have never had a positive ANA) . . . he said that he has never really seen my combination of blood work results, has never seen positive cytoplasmic staining without a positive ANA . . . good news is, its not fibro or CFS . . . bad news is he can't nail down anything definitive right now . . . He ordered all new bloodwork again . . . just had that done 2 months ago!\n\nHe started me on plaquenil - i have always been pretty resistant to start on meds as long as i could cope, but its been really hard lately . . . so achey, so tired - bone crushing fatigue, nausea every single stinking morning . . . i decided i had to do something . . . sick & tired of being sick & tired.\n\nHe said that if my latest issues are lupus related, the plaquenil will help. If it isn't, the plaquenil won't help and we are back to square one. He said all we can do at this point is approach it through a \"diagnosis via treatment\" method . . . I feel like i'm on \"House\"!!\n\nAnyway . . . hoping the plaquenil helps . . . hoping something helps.\n\nAnneAlienWife\n\nThere are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.\n\nI have the opposite problem....no indicators in the bloodwork other than a high positive ANA, but all the symptoms of a variety of AI problems. Lupus seems the most likely. Liver enzymes are occasionally high - and CRP, and white count is occasionally low - usually during a flare. Never had the AI markers run while in an acute flare - always wonder if something would show then. Anyway - have been on Plaquenil 6 mos. - treatment witnout firm diagnosis. I feel it has helped somewhat. Having fibro complicates the results. Will see what rheumie says next week at my 6 mos. visit.\n\nI really feel ya on the \"sick and tired of being sick and tired feeling\"! I waited too long to try medication. Even if it doesn't help you siginificantly - you have another answer of sorts and you're one step further along in the process. I hope the Plaquenil provides you with relief though, and you start feeling better soon!\n\nThe rheumy said that if it were Fibro or CFS, I would have predictable pain trigger points at certain locations . . . when he was \"testing\" the pain trigger points, it actually felt good (he could have kept at it for a while and saved me the money of going to see my massage therapist)! Also, CFS and Fibro are not considered autoimmune disorders and I have ai markers in my bloodwork along with chronically elevated liver enzymes, low potassium levels, low rdw levels . . .\n\nI suppose that it really doesn't mean that I couldn't have CFS, but he doesn't seem to think that CFS is my issue . . . really got no answers yet as to what really IS my problem, but at this point I really don't have much of a choice but to do the plaquenil thing and see if it works . . . I should have bloodwork results back next week and a follow up with the rheumy in July . . . hopefully by then the plaquenil will have had some results!\n\nGood luck with your rheumy visit next week! let us know how it goes?\n\nAnneAlienWife\n\nThere are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.\n\nAnne It's good he put you on plaquenil you might start feeling better, it takes about 6 months to start kicking in, hope you can get your answers soon. Take Care. DebbieAsthma,Lupus,H.B.P.,Dermatomyostis,Gastrparsis,Acid Reflux\n\nI hope the plaquenil helps . . . but it does take months to fully build in the system. Some patients feel relief quickly and others don't. It often takes a combination of meds to quiet things down if you are in a flare. Most of us aren't aware that it is working until we go off of it (because we think it isn't working) and then find out that it was actually doing a lot.\n\nHave you gone for your baseline eye exam??? I hope the plaquenil helps you LOTS.\n\nKeep us posted.\n\nBlessings!\n\nIn His Grip\n\nAlwaysRosie \"We can't control the waves, but we can learn how to surf!!\"\n\nI have the baseline eye exam scheduled, although not until the end of june - the opthalmologist was booked until then. The nurse seemed to think that it would be ok to wait that long.\n\nI am hoping the plaquenil works . . . i was on fairly high doses of chloraquine (same family as plaquenil) last year when i went to china (prophylactic for malaria since we were going to some pretty remote areas with less than desireable sanitation in the factories) . . . and, while it gave me the most bizarre dreams, i remember that my skin issues were practically cleared up by the time i got back after 3 1/2 weeks - i contributed it to the fact that it rained the entire time i was there and that the humidity was good for my skin . . . i dunno . . . maybe it wasnt the humidity? we will see . . .\n\nThanks for the replies :)\n\nAnneAlienWife\n\nThere are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.\n\nLOL. The humidity wasn't what did it, I live in very high humidity and that doesn't help my skin in the slightest! It was the malaria treatment that helped you out -- chloroquine is often used if/when plaquenil is not tolerated.\n\nI found the dreams went away after a few weeks, so I hope you feel better soon,"

        "text": "The ability to elucidate the primary structure of extremely small (picomole) amounts of biologically relevant proteins has had a profound impact in the biological and medical sciences. This capability, due to the recent development of protein microsequencing and amino acid analyzing technologies, has extended our knowledge of the structure and function of normal and abnormal proteins in health and disease. Furthermore, with the recent advances in the fields of recombinant DNA and genetic engineering, protein microsequencing is often a mandatory first step necessary for the design and synthesis of specific DNA probes needed to study gene structure and function. After probes are synthesized and used to identify genes, both sequencing of the DNA as well as synthesis of both peptides and additional DNA sequences from regions of the DNA sequence are necessary. These peptides are then used as immunological probes. This proposal is to place a state-of-the-art research grade protein and DNA sequencing system as well as protein synthesis into this hospital environment for use in a variety of basic research projects relating to biopolymers. Potential users for such biopolymer equipment in non-clinical research include the study of: (1) the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease and other degenerated diseases of the nervous system; (2) the isolation of the gene for human ferrochelatase; (3) post-translational modification of proteins; (4) molecular biology of human myeloid differentiation; (5) pulmonary surfactant proteins; (6) ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage and repair; (7) purification of the Type II thyroxine 5' deiodinase and cloning of its gene; (8) site- specific mutagenesis of von Willebrand's factor; (9) biochemistry, molecular biology and biological action of eosinophil and basophil proteins; (10) molecular biology of the polio virus receptor. The Biopolymer Lab will be placed in a laboratory dedicated to synthesis and structure studies and will become a central feature of the research efforts of many investigators at the hospital; it will greatly enhance our ability to make progress in these several areas."

        "text": "Different techniques for broadcasting digital multimedia have been developed and optimized for reception by mobile wireless devices. Such techniques include Forward Link Only (FLO), Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB), and Digital Video Broadcasting—Handheld (DVB-H). Digital multimedia broadcasting typically relies on one or more digital multimedia encoding standards, such as Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG)-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) H.263, or ITU H.264. The ITU H.264 standard corresponds to MPEG-4, Part 10, entitled “Advanced Video Coding.” These coding standards generally support transmission efficiency of multimedia sequences by encoding data in a compressed manner.\nSeveral broadcasting techniques deliver content as a series of physical or logical channels, providing a content selection experience similar to a conventional television. Each physical or logical channel carries digital data that encodes audio/video streams, audio/video clips, or other informational content. To switch channels, the mobile device acquires digital data, e.g., in the form of one or more packets or frames, from a selected channel and decodes the data to present the content to the user. Prolonged delays in selecting and presenting a channel are undesirable, and undermine the “channel surfing” experience to which users are accustomed. Accordingly, reduction of channel switching time is a significant concern in broadcasting."

        "text": "How Google Maps’ Menu Listings Will Change The Way Restaurants Are Found\n\nGoogle My Business’ restaurant clients will be able to attract customers who are searching for food items even when they’re not looking for a specific brand.\n\nBy David KaplanMay 15, 2017 2:33PM\n\nIt may seem like a mundane feature, but the ability for restaurants to publish their entire, detailed menus within their search results across Google could change the way eateries are ultimately discovered by patrons interested in specific meals.\n\nThe ability became available to businesses that use the Google My Business API at the end of April. Restaurants and food services outlets that have signed up with GMB can publish their entire menu to Google —itemized with descriptions, photos and prices.\n\nPrior to this GMB update, which covers all its food service client search results in Google as well as Google Maps, restaurants could include a link to their branded website’s menu. They could also insert a link to menus organized by third-party directories like MenuPages or AllMenus (both of which are owned by Grubhub/Seamless) or Zomato/Urbanspoon.\n\nA Big Difference For Food Services And Patrons\n\nWhile it may seem like a small difference, considering the amount of time consumers place on finding faster information and images can’t be underestimated. The GMB change takes the friction out of having to leave Google Maps, wait for an outside menu site to load, and then have to return to the main app for directions and other details such as reviews, directions, and hours.\n\nIt all stems from Google’s determination to offer users a complete walled garden where they don’t have to lose the ease of staying in its search app functions, whether it’s to hail a car or book a fitness appointment.\n\nArby’s, Denny’s, Quiznos, Panera Bread, and Bloomin’ Brands (the parent for Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar), are among the restaurants who first tried out the embedded menu search in GMB.\n\nFor Arby’s, embedding their menu listings within Google is about control.\n\n“We update our menu every month with new and limited time offers,” said Sonja Uppal, Arby’s Digital Marketing Supervisor, in a Google blog post. “With the new Google My Business Menu feature we now have control over our menu data. “We are able to provide our menu updates directly to Google via the Yext platform, and our updated menu populates on Google almost instantly. We no longer have to worry about old, unavailable menu items from third party sites showing up.”[Full disclosure: Yext is GeoMarketing’s parent company. More details on that relationship here.]\n\nA Google Maps’ search for the words “Bourbon.” “Bacon,” or “Burger” might pull up results for this Denny’s menu item, which is named for those main ingredients.\n\nThe ability to manage menu items for multiple locations had instant appeal to Denny’s, John Dillon, the restaurant chain’s SVP/CMO, told GeoMarketing.\n\n“The ability to highlight different menu items via an internet search based on geolocation certainly has its benefits,” Dillon said. “However, as a brand with 1,700-plus restaurants—over 90 percent of which are franchise owned—it’s also very important for us to ensure that our featured menu items are consistent across the board.”\n\nQuiznos began its use of GMB’s menu embed to promote its most recent “limited time only” lobster specials as well as its new slow-roasted, BBQ pulled pork subs.\n\nFor Quiznos, controlling how customers find its menu items and making sure patrons find the correct information is crucial and fundamental, said Tim Kraus, Quiznos’ director of Interactive and Innovation. “Not just for SEO strategy, but also for the user experience.\n\n“We want to make sure the consumer gets accurate information about what’s on our menu and it’s easiest when that comes direct from Quiznos,” Kraus told GeoMarketing. “There is value in 3rd party menu data services, but it can be difficult to update information with 3rd parties to ensure the right information is available to consumers.”\n\nThat said there is a clear SEO strategy at work here, Kraus noted. For one thing, adding menus and related information across Google’s platforms helps send people searching for specific menu items to the correct landing pages, “so brands can focus on conversions versus ranking a landing page,” Kraus said.\n\nQuiznos Pulled Pork Subs\n\nBrands Need To Be Everywhere\n\nThe Google My Business API lets restaurants and their developers publish menu data to each of their business locations. They can also create separate menus for breakfast, lunch, dinner and add sections (salads, entrees, dessert, drinks, etc.) that include individual menu items, each with a description, photos, and prices.\n\nMost restaurants still use those alternative menu options. And when it comes to consumers who are searching for a particular food item, the restaurants that stick to the previous menu listing methods could find their tables a little more empty versus competitors taking advantage of the upgrade in GMB.\n\nIn addition to Arby’s, Denny’s, and Quiznos, Panera Bread, and Bloomin’ Brands (the parent for Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba’s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar), are among the other restaurants who have been rolling out the embedded menu search in GMB.\n\nWhile there are advantages in using the menu embedding, Marc Ferrentino, Yext’s chief strategy officer, noted that there are important distinctions in the ways benefits can be extracted by restaurants using either discovery method.\n\n“A brand’s website is just as important as its presence on Google,” Ferrentino said. “And that’s what makes it so challenging to be a marketer in today’s digital world. The facts about a brand live in so many more places — beyond its own website and beyond Google. And because no one can control a consumer’s path to purchase, a brand has no choice but to be the best version of itself everywhere consumers could possibly find it. A brand needs to be awesome everywhere.”\n\nThe Meaning Of Structured Data And Unbranded Search\n\nWhen it comes to what this change in how Google menus can be placed within its apps and platforms, “this update is particularly exciting because consumers can access and tab through a brand’s menu directly from Google’s search results and Google Maps listings — without ever being redirected,” Ferrentino said. “If anything, this new capability streamlines the path to purchase and as I mentioned above, presents a multitude of new opportunities for brands to rank in unbranded search.”\n\nThe ability for a restaurant’s product to appear higher in the search rankings even when the person looking for an item doesn’t mention the place’s name is what gives restaurants an additional way to be discovered. And that’s all due to the use of structured data.\n\n“Google is constantly investing in new ways to leverage digital knowledge,” Ferrentino said. “With the launch of Google My Business API V3.3, Google has started accepting and indexing structured menu data.\n\nThis is incredibly exciting because if you use Yext to manage your menus, you can control the way your menus appear directly in Google’s search results. And arguably, the most powerful component to Google indexing structured menu data is that every single item on a brand’s menu presents a new keyword opportunity to be discovered.”\n\nIn other words, brands are no longer limited to their business description, or even location attributes, to optimize their business with these types of keywords.\n\n“By Google accepting structured menu data, for the first time, brands have the potential to rank for unbranded food searches, like ‘tater tots near me’ and ‘ice cream near me,’ that on-the-go consumers use to decide where to eat next,” Ferrentino continued. “If you’ve ever been in a car with hungry kids that want tator tots or ice cream, you know just how important these unbranded food searches are.”\n\nThe Age Of Added Discovery\n\nThe rise of social media the last few years and now the emergence of voice-activated connected intelligence through Amazon’s Alexa and other machine learning devices and programs, presents an even greater, more immediate way for consumers to find exactly what they’re looking for, noted Denny’s Dillon.\n\n“As a restaurant brand that serves up breakfast, lunch and dinner all-day, every day across our 1,700-plus restaurants, it’s critical for us to be able to continue to leverage new technology to make it more convenient for our guests to find information about our restaurants—especially when it comes to our menu,” Dillon said. “Having the ability to put our menu, in its entirety, at someone’s fingertips with a quick Google search certainly helps in that effort. In addition to helping our fans make possible decisions on what they may want to eat before they even set foot in our restaurants, it also gives us the ability to expose new audiences to Denny’s extensive lineup of classic diner fare.”\n\nThe Google My Business update for restaurant menus comes as the search giant is experiencing greater challenges to its search and mapping dominance as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Snap, and others demonstrate their own individual abilities to match users with brands’ products based on location.\n\nAnd as it often does, Google itself is able to keep ahead of the encroachments in the area of search and geography. And in part, it’s the demands of its users and business clients who depend on Google to help fulfill those customer connections.\n\n“Google maps will continue to be a valuable piece to drive traffic to Quiznos, in not just web traffic but also direct traffic to Quiznos locations via ‘directions’, ‘call ahead’, ‘order ahead’ and other features & functionality that consumers continue to employ from Google Maps,” Quiznos’ Kraus said. “We will continue to use and find ways to boost traffic from Google Maps for Quiznos.”"

        "text": "I'll only shortly react to this since it's a bit off the Monza topic, but I want to show my point of view on racing in general. I disagree that Verstappen gave room on the inside and thus had no need to give room on the outside. Leclerc was far enough alongside to be entitled the space, before the door was shut on him. Same here in Monza, Hamilton was far enough alongside to be given a car's width of space and if the black/white flag was available in Austria, I am fairly sure they would have applied it to Verstappen too (which means a warning would have been given). I don't really know why the drivers nowadays think they can \"own\" a corner by having the inside line or the racing line, or by the virtue of \"being ahead\". Those unwritten rules are absolute nonsense in my opinion.\n\nFirst of all the black/white flag has always been available. The moment has been reviewed after the race with resulting no further action. So that clearly tells that there was nothing wrong with the action of Verstappen.\n\nBut back to the bot hsituations. The big difference is the position of the defending car. leclerc / Verstappen, Leclerc was on the outside as he gave to much space. Leclerc should haven taken his loss and break and take the inside. There was plenty of space available. Only it looks it was not possible, but that's because we continue the line Leclerc was taking, keep staying on the outside and running out of the track. It was Leclerc driving into Verstappen and not the other way around. verstappen was in a position he didn't have to give space on that side anymore.\n\nLeclerc vs Hamilton, Leclerc was defending on the inside, after he blocked Hamilton out of turn 3. Hamilton was afterwards partly passed Leclerc before leclerc passed by again and had a bit the lead before turn 4. But Here he moved roughly to the right a pushed Hamilton from the track, he didn't give him 1 car space. That they didn't touch was only because of Hamilton stearing to the grass to avoid contact. Otherwise it would have been an accident, that the FIA gave the black/white flag tells that it was not a professional move. The reason he was not getting a penalty was because there was no contact, bit weird, as the only reason there was no contact was because Hamilton avoided a crash by going of the track. Lost time, dirty tyres,so weak explanation of the FIA.\n\nFirst of all the black/white flag has always been available. The moment has been reviewed after the race with resulting no further action. So that clearly tells that there was nothing wrong with the action of Verstappen.\n\nIt has always been there, but it was not really used anymore. If you read the news, you could have read that Michael Masi said he was reviving the flag as a sort of \"yellow card\" to give drivers more knowledge on what is allowed and what not, without directly penalizing them. So yes, it was always there, but they have only started to really use it again since the Belgian Grand Prix. Anyways, the \"warning\" was given in an instant, and it took them multiple hours to come to the conclusion that Verstappen didn't get a penalty. If he really didn't do anything wrong, they wouldn't have taken that long.\n\nBut back to the bot hsituations. The big difference is the position of the defending car. leclerc / Verstappen, Leclerc was on the outside as he gave to much space. Leclerc should haven taken his loss and break and take the inside. There was plenty of space available. Only it looks it was not possible, but that's because we continue the line Leclerc was taking, keep staying on the outside and running out of the track. It was Leclerc driving into Verstappen and not the other way around. verstappen was in a position he didn't have to give space on that side anymore.\n\nWhy is Leclerc not allowed to go on the outside? Because you decide that beforehand? He had the speed and the overlap, that's the whole point I am trying to make. You are saying Leclerc isn't allowed to overtake Verstappen back around the outside, while Verstappen didn't block the outside off yet. If Verstappen was there, there was no room for Leclerc to get on his outside in the first place. Why didn't he have to give space? That's exactly what I don't like about racing nowadays. Drivers (and especially newer fans as well) think that a driver can claim the space. That is in fact the only point I am trying to make. Both moves were wrong in my opinion and didn't result in a penalty. On the one hand, we should be happy that penalties aren't easily given, but on the other hand I would love to see some more respect between drivers on track.\n\nIt's exactly the other way around, Martti. I'm talking about being stricter on defensive moves. What we learned today is that you shouldn't try overtaking the way Albon and Hamilton did, because the guy ahead can simply push you off the track. The only thing you end up with is dirty tyres, loss of several positions (Albon) and possible a damaged car. So it is much better to just stay behind and go to the finish.\n\nThe current policy discourages overtaking. Handing out some penalties for overly aggressive defending would encourage it.\n\nI am the biggest tifoso of Ferrari, and i'm in paradise for Carletto's victory.\n\nYet i totally agree with this statement, Leclerc's defence was too much, there's a difference between defending aggressively and pushing your opponent off the track. Allowing this kind of moves discourages overtaking.\n\nam the biggest tifoso of Ferrari, and i'm in paradise for Carletto's victory.\n\nMe too, Alessio\n\nBut before I agree to any statements , I want to see the bigger picture , not just one particularity ... because , on one side , Ham was talking about seeing some consistency from the stewards until this event ( thinking at Montreal and forgetting about Austria where he didn’t have anything to lose/win) , But on the other side , a super talented and valuable youngster like Charles should come to a double loser position in all this equation , no matter the facts... and the fact is that the only way for the stewards to show any consistency at all ,exactly what Ham wishes for , is to keep a balance/consistency in line of judgement between Austria and Monza , as well for the rest of the season , and then draw a line and take measures and rules to apply for the seasons to come\n\nYou don’t spoil a huge talent like Max , allowing him, in over 50% of the s..t he made in order to find his own line of progress, to get away with it , and then penalize another real talent for the future as Charles by braking consistency when Ham and fans wish for it , even if it proves they do have a strong position on this case\n\nWhy is Leclerc not allowed to go on the outside? Because you decide that beforehand?\n\nWhere do I say he was not allowed, he is allowed to do what ever he wants. He is just in a losing position there, a position from where he can't claim anything. He can try to overtake from the outside, but with the risk there is no space and that he has to go off the track! I do like racing when the drivers go to the limit and sometimes over, but when it comes like the Leclerc Hamilton situation I think it's getting close to the edge. I support the black/white flag for it though. I think it was a perfect solution, just surprised that Leclerc didn't get a penalty for the multiple moving, blocking and corner cutting after the black/white flag. To me it doesn't matter who would have won the race. It's just a weird call from the stewards to completely ignore these actions.\n\nSummary; Big fan of Black/white flag, 100% support that, as we want drivers to race and not being bitching about everything. So given them a yellow card principle is perfect. Just two yellow cards is still a red card, what is a penalty..\n\nSummary; Big fan of Black/white flag, 100% support that, as we want drivers to race and not being bitching about everything.

He wasn't in a losing position, as he made exactly the same move the lap before and made it stick - even though he had a bigger disadvantage that lap. There was no reason for him not to try it again. I like it too when drivers go to the limit, but to me the limit is that you keep space for the other car once he gets alongside. I do understand that that is not the rules F1 follow at the moment, but I do think it's what they should do. That is what I am trying to say.\n\nAlso, the only thing I think Leclerc could have been penalized for after the \"yellow card\", is the corner cut. Honestly I think they let it slip because 1. Italian GP and 2. Vettel/Canada incident. While Leclerc was \"moving multiple times\" on the straight to break the slipstream, I think he was doing it safely, leaving space at either side of the road while moving and only going back to the racing line for the braking zone. The sporting regulations in F1 don't involve exact rules on what is allowed and what not. If they thought it was unfair, they would have given the black-white flag way earlier. I also don't think he did any wrong blocking. There was one moment in Curva Grande, but I think that was mainly caused by the fact they were going through a corner.\n\nAnyways, I agree with you about the summary, but with Martti as well. :)\n\nEdit: btw I don't necessarily think your opinion is wrong, I am mainly disagreeing with the way F1 is currently look at racing and what is fair and what is not. I would personally love to see it change a bit with more respect for each other and more respect for the white lines as well. :)"

UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will also attend.\n\nSyria’s acceptance of Mr. Annan’s proposed plan Tuesday could cause more rifts among Arab leaders, already split over how to end the bloodshed. Arab countries are divided between the Gulf states and others skeptical that Syria will fulfill its promises. Those countries are pushing for more pressure against the Syrian president while others insist on a Syrian solution.\n\nIraq, which now takes over the presidency of the Arab League for the coming year, falls into the latter camp."

Six of the 19 species were identified as commercially and ecologically important for the mangrove biodiversity – Blue spotted Mudskipper (Boleophthalmus boddarti), two types of pomphret (Pampus argenteus and Pampus chinensis), Northern whiting (Sillago sihama), John’s Snapper or Golden snapper (Lutjanus johnii), and Giant tiger prawns or Asian tiger shrimps (Penaeus monodon).\n\n“Due to developmental activities and anthropogenic changes, there is a lot of pressure on mangrove ecosystem, especially within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), without knowing the value of these salt-tolerant trees. Apart from their importance in playing a critical role by acting as natural sponges and controlling flooding, there is a large biodiversity that thrives on this ecosystem,” said Annam Pavan Kumar, senior scientist, CIFE-Mumbai who carried out the study, along with Raju Ram, Ashok Kumar Jaiswar, Gireesh Babu Pathakota, Aparna Chaudhari, and Gopal Krishna, all CIFE scientists.\n\nApart from these, larvae of ornamental fishes such as Malabar glassy perchlet or Barehead glassfish (Ambassis dussumieri) and Indian glassy fish (Pseudambassis ranga) were also observed of which the Barehead glassfish is widely distributed throughout Indo-Western Pacific region while the Indian glassy fish is endemic to freshwaters of Asia.\n\n“Till date the number of species using mangrove forests as breeding grounds was not available as larvae of aquatic species are very small and difficult to distinguish,” said Kumar. “This is the first report from India on utilizing DNA barcoding approach to identify indistinguishable fin and shellfish larvae from mangroves.”\n\nA total of 80 larvae (fish and shellfish) were collected from selected mangrove zones from Maharashtra including Gorai, Mumbai, Shirgaon mangrove forests near Ratnagiri, and Karanja near Uran, Navi Mumbai from September, 2015 to February, 2016 using hand nets with a mesh size of 0.2-0.3mm. “In this study using molecular tools, we characterized the species diversity giving an indication of the aquatic life that calls mangrove forests their home. This will further enhance the need to protect these areas and also identifies the economic value they add,” said Kumar.\n\nDNA barcoding relies on unique sequence of mitochondrial DNA specific to the species (using a single gene to identify a species through a series of sequences). The scientists first identified the adult specimen of each species and generated their barcodes based on their mitochondrial DNA. Using that as reference, the DNA sequence for fish and shrimp larvae collected from mangrove forests were compared and identified. “This is a standard global procedure, which we followed,” added Kumar. “More such studies are needed in mangrove areas along the entire Indian coastline to detect ecologically sensitive zones and declare those areas as reserved forest to avoid development. Currently, the data is lacking and it is a vital requirement to improve conservation.”\n\n“The government is focusing on blue economy in terms of sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth. The mission will help in leveraging the blue economy for the country’s overall economic growth,” said M Rajeevan, MoES secretary at an event in Delhi on Saturday. “Such studies using DNA barcoding is very useful for the identification of species in areas where research cannot be carried out very easily. If more such efforts are done, we will be able discover a wide variety of species within mangrove forests giving impetus to protect these areas better. Our aim should be use this research to ensure such species do not get wiped out,” said N Mohan Karnat, additional principal chief conservator of forests, Maharashtra forest department and director, Institute of Wood Science and Technology, Bengaluru."

View Summary\n\nThis paper details the development of a mobile research platform to better understand the relative effectiveness of media channels, and gives case study examples of the impact of this method in the US and Australia. Businesses are facing new challenges with a range of advertising channels and a shortening consumer attention span. These challenges are not met by traditional research methods that require large budgets or take a long time to conduct. Mobile data collection can address these challenges by providing faster, cheaper and higher quality information from consumers. Examples are given from a rugby league survey in Australia, where it was found that 'in the moment' surveys are possible with even the most avid fans and can generate high levels of engagement; and the US Super Bowl, where it was found that mobile generated a quicker response and identified the most popular ads.\n\n3\n\nWorld Cup: Is it a good idea? Exploring the degree of Brazilians' optimism\n\nThis paper discusses changing attitudes towards Brazil's hosting of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, examining how these have changed from positive to more negative and how this may impact on sponsoring brands. View Summary\n\nThis paper discusses changing attitudes towards Brazil's hosting of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, examining how these have changed from positive to more negative and how this may impact on sponsoring brands. When the event was first announced, reaction was positive: Brazil was considered successful and a country of the future. The event would be important not only for the economy, but an opportunity for companies and their brands to showcase themselves. However, as time has gone on there have seen a series of situations which have not only saddened and disappointed the Brazilian people, but have also weakened global confidence in the country's ability to host such a large scale global event. The negativity around the World Cup presents challenges for brands, but there are a number of approaches that could be taken to sponsorship, including: avoiding direct associations with FIFA or the World Cup, focussing on the Brazilian team and its players, and focussing on positive features of the population such as its pride, hope and diversity.\n\nThis experimental study examined what is the optimal decision for a company whose brand is endorsed by a celebrity immersed in a scandal (revoking versus continuing the endorsement) as a function of brand/endorser fit (congruence versus incongruence) and of the veracity of the negative event created by the celebrity’s reaction (denying versus admitting the facts). View Summary\n\nThis experimental study examined what is the optimal decision for a company whose brand is endorsed by a celebrity immersed in a scandal (revoking versus continuing the endorsement) as a function of brand/endorser fit (congruence versus incongruence) and of the veracity of the negative event created by the celebrity’s reaction (denying versus admitting the facts). In the case of congruence, revoking the endorsement is suboptimal with respect to brand attitude and purchase intention. Furthermore, denying lowered the endorser’s trustworthiness which, in turn, hampered attitude and intention. Managerial and theoretical implications, as well as directions for further research, were also considered.\n\nThe 2010 NCAA Men's Division 1 Basketball Tournament was aired as a joint venture between CBS Television and Turner Broadcasting.

The networks used a strategy from the Nielsen Company in order to measure the size and behaviour of the event's audience on in-home television, out-of-home television, online and mobile. The insights include that 176 million fans engaged with the tournament over the two-and-a-half-week period, making it the biggest sporting event of 2010, and over 73 million watched it away from home, a larger number than anticipated. The paper also highlights the effectiveness of Coca-Cola's Coke Zero advertisements which ran during the event, including the fact that the brand's ads achieved a 49% brand recall score with adults 18-49 - some 36% higher than it scored in other televised sporting events.\n\n6\n\nWarning Flags on the Race Track: The Global Markets' Verdict on Formula One Sponsorship\n\nThe globalization of media content has encouraged the growth of cross-cultural promotional channels.

View Summary\n\nThe globalization of media content has encouraged the growth of cross-cultural promotional channels. Yet, empirical evaluations of advertising strategies at an international level are sparse. This study advances research in this emerging area by analyzing the global financial markets’ valuation of commercial sponsorships in Formula One (F1) motor racing. Although previous research indicated that US markets have approved of similar promotional investments, the results of this international event study demonstrated that the market value of firms entering into F1 sponsorships decline upon announcement. The level of investment and nationality congruence of the sponsorship appear to enhance the probability for negative returns in shareholder value.\n\n7\n\nThe determinants of the sports team sponsor’s brand equity: a cross-country comparison in Asia\n\nThis research attempts to investigate the determinants of a sports team sponsor's brand equity and whether the proposed structural relationships vary across countries. View Summary\n\nThis research attempts to investigate the determinants of a sports team sponsor's brand equity and whether the proposed structural relationships vary across countries. Field data are collected from sports team fans in two Asian economies/countries, i.e. Taiwan and Indonesia. According to the findings, in general, team identification and perceived congruence between the sponsor and the sponsored sports team affect the sponsor's credibility, which in turn has an impact on the sponsor's brand equity. 'Country' moderates the above structural relationships. However, the effects of team identification and perceived congruence on the sponsor's credibility do not receive supportive evidence in Taiwan and Indonesia respectively.\n\n8\n\nThe Ethics of Celebrity-Athlete Endorsement: What Happens When a Star Steps Out of Bounds?\n\nCelebrity athletes are a mainstay of popular culture and an increasingly important part of the marketing ecosystem. View Summary\n\nCelebrity athletes are a mainstay of popular culture and an increasingly important part of the marketing ecosystem. As product endorsers, they can influence brand attitudes and sales but also have broader societal implications for the firm. The recent string of bad behavior by celebrity athletes raises important ethical questions about firms that use the famous and infamous to endorse branded products. The conceptual framework presented in the current study provides a theoretical approach-based on virtue ethics-for evaluating the retention of tainted celebrity affiliates. This framework is applied to three well-known situations to examine the ethical implications of what initially were good choices for firms, their brands, and their consumers. The overarching goal of this article is to stimulate managers to think more deeply about the interconnections between their core company values, the athlete endorsers they select, and the ultimate effect of those decisions on their brands in the marketplace if things go wrong.\n\nThis study investigates brand loyalty and other brand performance metrics in the UK sportswear market. It utilises consumer purchase data kindly provided by Taylor Nelson Sofres. The study finds that empirical regularities discovered by Andrew Ehrenberg and colleagues apply to sportswear brands – including iconic brands such as Nike and Adidas. The main findings are that: (1) sportswear brands enjoy polygamous loyalty from their buyers; (2) the market exhibits the classic double jeopardy pattern whereby smaller brands have slightly lower loyalty; (3) consumers switch between sports brands approximately in line with their market share; and (4) a brand’s performance with respect to any demographic based consumer sub-group is approximately the same as it is in the population generally – that is, sportswear brands tend not to have markedly different appeal to particular demographic segments. Therefore, even iconic brands and self expressive, emblematic product categories show predictable patterns in brand performance. These well-documented empirical patterns should be used by research providers and brand managers to contextualise brand performance.\n\n10\n\nUsing global online panels: a comparative study on the Beijing 2008 Olympics\n\nThis paper assesses the wider considerations that should be taken into account when using international online access panels. View Summary\n\nThis paper assesses the wider considerations that should be taken into account when using international online access panels. In doing so, examines the learnings from a survey on the Olympic Games - The Olympic Interest Survey - which examined how consumers plan to use the internet both up to and during the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. It argues that even when conducting a survey on a topic with global awareness and interest, it is important to vary the survey methodology in recognition of the fact that how people respond will vary by country. Key considerations include understanding what people are likely to have in common, as well as differentiating factors such as levels of online penetration, the use of rewards, screening and localisation. Much like the Olympics themselves, the Olympic Interest Survey demonstrated unity in opinion across nations as well as differences between them: for example, there are greater levels of interest in table tennis in China than elsewhere, and Brazilians' have a particular enthusiasm for volleyball, but almost everywhere the majority of people agreed that television would be the primary means of watching the event, with other media supplementing this coverage.\n\nTeenagers currently spend an estimated $153 billion a year on everything from computers to cars to clothes (Brand, 2000). View Summary\n\nTeenagers currently spend an estimated $153 billion a year on everything from computers to cars to clothes (Brand, 2000). Trend conscious teens are very active in utilizing the media and advertising in seeking out the latest products, services, and fashions (Zollo, 1995). A greater understanding of teens’ role model influences can help organizations and their advertising agencies more effectively target and communicate to this growing market. In this study, we examine the effect of athlete role models on teenagers’ purchase intentions and behaviors. Results from a survey of 218 adolescents are discussed with implications and future research directions for advertising and sports marketing researchers.\n\nThis paper compares the intense loyalty achieved by football clubs with brand loyalty. To marketers, football can be regarded as a product sector and football clubs as brands. View Summary\n\nThis paper compares the intense loyalty achieved by football clubs with brand loyalty. To marketers, football can be regarded as a product sector and football clubs as brands. However in this context the clubs are unique. They engender phenomenal brand loyalty despite their strengths and weaknesses. This is totally different from almost all other product sectors where brand switching occurs which reflect them. The paper examines whether brands in other sectors can benefit from this traditional loyalty to football brands, debating the reasons for football brand choice, looking at causes for brand loyalty and differences in other sectors. It is shown that certain brands seem to have encompassed attributes which are associated with football and other sectors could benefit from understanding the contributory factors which engender similar responses.\n\n14\n\nThe Use of Two-Stage Survey Design in Collecting Data From Those Who Have Attended Periodic or Special Events\n\nDiscusses the problems of obtaining satisfactory survey samples of people attending special events, away from their homes. View Summary\n\nDiscusses the problems of obtaining satisfactory survey samples of people attending special events, away from their homes. Exit surveys and other attempts to interview on the spot are difficult for several reasons, unless the interviews are very short: the interview environment is too distracting, and the representativeness of the sample cannot be ensured. A good solution is two-stage interviewing, in which basic details such as telephone numbers are obtained on the spot, from which a sample can be selected for interviewing later, e.g. by telephone. The method is illustrated by two examples: a sporting event in a U.S. city, and the annual `Shakespeare on the Green' event in Omaha, Nebraska. The sampling methods used and response rates are described in both cases. Co-operation at Stage 1 proved higher than expected, and by changing the interview environment much better data were collected. Although more expensive than a one-stage method, the cost differential is not as great as might be expected, since pre-recruitment makes the follow-up calls more productive, and extra cost may well be justified by the much higher quality of the data."

Factual Background\n\n       About 1:30 a.m. on November 5, 2011, Sergeant Rick Clouse of the Franklin Police\nDepartment was on patrol near the intersection of McEwen Drive and Carothers. Sergeant\nClouse, who was the supervisor of the midnight shift, testified at trial that he saw a white\npickup truck traveling south on Carothers. The truck, driven by the appellant, proceeded at\na high rate of speed through a flashing red light at the intersection. Sergeant Clouse\nimmediately began following the truck. At the top of a hill, Sergeant Clouse saw Officer Ben\nJones “running stationary radar on Carothers.” Officer Jones radioed Sergeant Clouse to\ninform him that the appellant was driving fifty-five miles per hour in a forty-mile-per-hour\nzone. Sergeant Clouse responded that he intended to stop the appellant for running the red\nlight. Officer Jones followed Sergeant Clouse to assist with the stop.\n\n       Sergeant Clouse said that they proceeded south on Carothers toward Liberty Pike. As\nthey approached the intersection, Sergeant Clouse activated his car’s blue lights. Upon\nreaching the intersection, the appellant made a right turn onto Liberty Pike. After making\nthe turn, Sergeant Clouse activated his car’s siren. Approximately forty-five seconds after\nSergeant Clouse activated the blue lights, the appellant stopped his vehicle at a curb.\n\n        Sergeant Clouse stated that he and Officer Jones parked behind the appellant. Sergeant\nClouse got out of his vehicle and approached the driver’s side of the truck, and Officer Jones\napproached the passenger side. When Sergeant Clouse made contact with the appellant, he\nimmediately smelled alcohol and saw a bottle of Bud Light beer in the console next to the\nappellant. The appellant’s eyes were watery and bloodshot. Sergeant Clouse asked the\nappellant if he had been drinking. The appellant responded that he had consumed two beers.\nSergeant Clouse informed the appellant that he had been stopped for speeding and running\na red light and asked the appellant to step out of the vehicle so that Sergeant Clouse could\nascertain whether the appellant was fit to drive. When the appellant complied, Sergeant\nClouse confirmed that the smell of alcohol was coming from the appellant. He also noticed\nthat the appellant had “a fresh dip of snuff” in his lip.\n\n      Sergeant Clouse said that he asked the appellant to perform field sobriety tests, and\nthe appellant agreed. The first test, the “walk and turn,” had been standardized by the\nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Tennessee\nGovernor’s Board of Highway Safety. Sergeant Clouse explained:\n\n              Usually we try to use either the fog line or either a line on the\n              street. They are basically straight and they are easy to identify\n              and they are thick. They are not something really skinny.\n\n                                             -2-\n\f                     Usually what I do is I have the person stand on the line.\n              Usually with his right foot in front of his left or his left foot in\n              front of his right touching heel to toe with their arms down . . .\n              . They stand heel to toe on the line with their arms down to their\n              side. They are required to remain in that position until I get\n              finished explaining the tasks and demonstrating that for them.\n\n        Sergeant Clouse said that while he was instructing the appellant on how to perform\nthe test, the appellant lost his balance. The appellant “played it off a little bit” by stepping\noff the line and walking around in a small circle. Sergeant Clouse stepped off the witness\nstand and demonstrated how the appellant lost his balance and walked in a circle.\n\n       Sergeant Clouse said that thereafter, the appellant refused to perform any field\nsobriety tests. Sergeant Clouse asked the appellant if he wanted to perform a different task,\nand the appellant repeated that he did not want to perform any field sobriety tests. Sergeant\nClouse informed the appellant that if he did not take the tests, he would be arrested. After\nbeing handcuffed, the appellant agreed to take the tests.\n\n       Sergeant Clouse said that he uncuffed the appellant and demonstrated the test. The\nappellant did not ask any questions and could not “maintain the start position. He was\nswaying.” During the test, the appellant began “flaring,” which Sergeant Clouse said was\nraising his arms slightly to the side instead of keeping his hands straight down at his sides.\nSergeant Clouse demonstrated “flaring” for the jury. Sergeant Clouse said that the appellant\nalso stepped off the line and “cant[ed]” his feet. Sergeant Clouse explained that the\nappellant’s heels were on the line but that his feet were not. Sergeant Clouse demonstrated\n“canting,” which he described as walking as if “you’ve got Bozo feet.”\n\n       Sergeant Clouse said that the appellant exhibited five of the eight clues of impairment\nestablished by the NHTSA: (1) he could not maintain the proper start position, (2) he used\nhis arms for balance, (3) he stepped off the line, (4) he did not always step heel to toe, and\n(5) he did not perform the turn as Sergeant Clouse had demonstrated. He asserted, “[I]f\nyou’ve got two clues out of the eight, that normally says that a person could possibly be\nimpaired and that that person [is] considered to be over the per se legal limit of .08.”\n\n       Sergeant Clouse said that the second test was the “one leg stand,” which was also an\nNHTSA standardized test. First, Sergeant Clouse ascertained that the appellant had no health\nproblems that would prevent him from performing the test. Next, Sergeant Clouse explained\nand demonstrated that the appellant was to stand on one leg while raising the other leg six\ninches, pointing the toes of the raised foot, keeping his hands at his sides, and counting as\ninstructed.\n\n                                              -3-\n\f        Sergeant Clouse said that the appellant attempted to perform the test. He exhibited\nall four clues of impairment by swaying, losing his balance, “flaring” his arms, and setting\nhis foot down. Sergeant Clouse said that four clues of impairment were associated with the\ntest and that exhibiting two clues indicated “that the person could be impaired.”\n\n       Sergeant Clouse said that the third test was the “Romberg Task,” which required the\nappellant to stand with both feet together,1 arms down at his sides, head tilted back, and eyes\nclosed. The appellant was supposed to open his eyes when thirty seconds had elapsed.\nSergeant Clouse explained:\n\n                         Usually if a person is slower than 30 seconds it usually\n                  shows that you’re under the influence of a depressant such as\n                  alcohol. If you’re faster, say 15 seconds, when you’re supposed\n                  to be estimating 30, that usually indicates that you’re under the\n                  influence of a stimul[ant] such as . . . meth[amphetamine] or\n                  crack cocaine.\n\n        Sergeant Clouse said that when the appellant opened his eyes, thirty-six seconds, not\nthirty, had elapsed. Additionally, the appellant had “pronounced swaying” during the test\nand “had to be instructed twice to put his feet together.” The prosecutor asked Sergeant\nClouse, “How was 36 seconds is that good, is that bad?” Sergeant Clouse responded, “It’s\nnot 30 seconds.”\n\n       Sergeant Clouse said that near the end of the traffic stop, the appellant asserted that\nhe had consumed only two beers and that he was not “drunk.” Sergeant Clouse told the\nappellant that he could arrange for the appellant to take a personal or portable breath test\n(PBT). The appellant refused to take the PBT.\n\n       Sergeant Clouse stated that at least five times, the appellant asserted that he had\nconsumed only two beers. Sergeant Clouse asserted, “[I]t’s been my experience that pretty\nmuch after two beers that’s the last thing that a person remembered consciously drinking.\nIf they’re not a raging alcoholic.”\n\n        After the appellant refused the breath test, Sergeant Clouse arrested him for driving\nunder the influence. He based his arrest upon “the totality of the circumstances, the smell\nof alcohol, the beer in the console, he admitted to drinking, his driving behavio[r], and the\nfact that he didn’t do very well on the FSTs.” After the arrest, Sergeant Clouse searched the\nappellant’s vehicle. He touched the bottle of Bud Light that was in the console and\n\n       1\n           Sergeant Clouse demonstrated how the appellant was supposed to stand during the test.\n\n                                                    -4-\n\fdetermined that it was cold and had condensation on it. A twelve-pack of cold Bud Light\nwas located behind the passenger seat and had only seven cans remaining. Sergeant Clouse\nasked the appellant about the pack, and the appellant said, “‘Oh, okay, yeah, okay, whatever,\nall right. I had three beers instead of two, okay, I lied.’”\n\n      Sergeant Clouse stated that he did not have video recording equipment in his patrol\ncar. However, Officer Jones was driving a newer patrol car that was equipped with a video\ncamera that recorded the appellant’s performance on the field sobriety tests. The State\nshowed the video to the jury.\n\n       On cross-examination, Sergeant Clouse said that Carothers was a four-lane divided\nhighway and that when he first saw the appellant, the appellant was driving south. Sergeant\nClouse was “pretty sure” the light was red when the appellant drove through the intersection\nwithout stopping. Sergeant Clouse did not see the appellant weave or swerve while he was\ndriving. Additionally, Sergeant Clouse noticed that the bottle of beer in the console was not\nempty.\n\n        Sergeant Clouse clarified that he was trained in the NHTSA-approved standards for\nfield sobriety tests and that he had in-service training on field sobriety tests every year.\n\n        Sergeant Clouse said that while he was giving the instructions for the walk and turn\ntest, the appellant stepped off the line twice. Sergeant Clouse acknowledged that the video\ndid not show that the appellant swayed during the test. Sergeant Clouse considered the\nappellant’s stepping off the line twice to be an indicator of his intoxication. He explained\nthat when the appellant stepped off of the line, he refused to take other tests. He said that the\nappellant did not step off the starting position the second time he performed the test.\n\n        Sergeant Clouse said that during the test, the appellant was not allowed to move his\nhands. He acknowledged, however, that the NHTSA instruction manual stated that the clue\nfor intoxication was that the “[s]uspect raises one or both arms more than six inches from the\nside in order to maintain balance.” Sergeant Clouse said that the appellant’s walking\n“pigeon-toed” was an indicator of intoxication. He acknowledged that the NHTSA\ninstruction manual stated that the clue for intoxication was when the “suspect steps so that\none foot is entirely off the line.” He agreed that if part of the appellant’s foot remained on\nthe line, the NHTSA might consider it “okay”; nevertheless, he considered “canting” to be\na clue of intoxication.\n\n       Regarding the one leg stand, Sergeant Clouse acknowledged that he instructed the\nappellant that he could put his foot down if necessary. Sergeant Clouse said that “[p]utting\nyour foot down is maintaining balance. The fact that he wasn’t looking at his foot is failure\n\n                                               -5-\n\fto follow the instructions.” Sergeant Clouse said putting a foot down was “not the end of the\nworld. He just needs to pick it back up and continue to count.” Sergeant Clouse agreed that\non direct examination, he “may have” testified that the appellant failed all four clues of the\ntest. He further acknowledged that the appellant did not stop the test prematurely, which was\none of the four clues of intoxication.\n\n        Sergeant Clouse said that during the Romberg test, the appellant was supposed to\nclose his eyes, count thirty seconds, and then open his eyes. The appellant opened his eyes\nat thirty-six seconds. After Sergeant Clouse’s response, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n                     [Defense Counsel:] And is that a lot to be – that’s\n              missing it by six seconds. But is that a lot? Does that indicate\n              he’s intoxicated?\n\n                     [Sergeant Clouse:] It’s not 30 seconds.\n\n                    [Defense Counsel:] So what if somebody did it in 28\n              second[s]?\n\n                     [Sergeant Clouse:] Then it would not be 30 seconds.\n\nSergeant Clouse also acknowledged that the appellant’s speech was not slurred and that he\nwas not belligerent.\n\n        Patrol Officer Ben Jones testified that at approximately 1:30 a.m. on November 5,\n2011, he was parked in a turnaround median on Carothers Parkway north of Liberty Pike,\nrunning stationary radar, when he saw a white pickup truck drive over the hill at a rate of\nfifty-five miles per hour in a forty-mile-per-hour zone. Sergeant Clouse was behind the\ntruck. Officer Jones radioed Sergeant Clouse to inform him that the appellant was speeding.\nSergeant Clouse responded that he intended to stop the appellant’s vehicle. Officer Jones\nbegan following Sergeant Clouse to assist with the stop.\n\n        Officer Jones said that when Sergeant Clouse activated the blue lights on his patrol\ncar, the appellant began driving more slowly and eventually parked his truck. The officers\nparked behind the appellant. Sergeant Clouse approached the driver’s side, and Officer Jones\napproached the passenger’s side. Officer Jones looked through the passenger window and\nsaw a Bud Light beer bottle in the center console; the bottle was not empty. Officer Jones\nsmelled alcohol on the appellant when he got out of the truck. He also observed that the\nappellant’s eyes were bloodshot and watery.\n\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\f        Officer Jones said that he watched as Sergeant Clouse administered the field sobriety\ntests. The appellant performed poorly on the walk and turn test by stepping off the line and\nfailing to maintain his balance. Afterward, the appellant said he did not want to perform any\nmore tests. The officers arrested the appellant, who then asserted that he was willing to\nperform additional field sobriety tests. Officer Jones said, “The second attempt for the walk\nand turn task [was] similar to what Sergeant Clouse described. He just missed heel to toe,\nimproper turn.” The State asked, “Did it appear to you that he was canting his feet out as\nOfficer Clouse described?” Officer Jones responded, “Yes, sir.”\n\n        The prosecutor then said, “Now, I’m going to skip ahead a little bit because Officer\nClouse testified to the majority of the FSTs.” Officer Jones said that after the arrest, he asked\nthe appellant to take a breath test or have his blood drawn and tested. Officer Jones then read\nthe implied consent form advising the appellant of the consequences of violating the implied\nconsent law. When he finished, the appellant asked him to “just kind of plain [E]nglish to\nread it to him.” Officer Jones summarized the tenets of the implied consent law, and the\nappellant again refused to take either test. Thereafter, Officer Jones transported the appellant\nto the justice center. During the drive, the appellant was “very chatty.” Officer Jones opined\nthat the appellant was under the influence of alcohol and that he was unfit to drive.\n\n        On cross-examination, Officer Jones said that he had been trained on the NHTSA\ntests. He said that the video showed that as he was transporting the appellant to the justice\ncenter, the appellant asked if he could still take a blood or breath test. Officer Jones surmised\nthat he did not respond to the appellant’s question because he “might not have heard him.”\nOfficer Jones explained that a microphone was located in the backseat, so the appellant’s\nvoice was clear on the recording; however, Officer Jones could not “hear everything over the\nradio and that cage, necessarily, every time.”\n\n       Officer Jones said that during the appellant’s first attempt to perform the walk and\nturn test, he lost his balance and could not “maintain the start position”; therefore, the test\nwas stopped. During the second attempt, the appellant missed touching heel to toe, turned\nimproperly, and stopped before the task was complete. Defense counsel said, “I thought\nthat’s what [Sergeant] Clouse said, but I didn’t – I don’t think I got that from his the last –\nthe second time I asked him that.” Officer Jones clarified that the appellant’s mistake was\nthat during the test, he asked a question before he finished.\n\n        Officer Jones said that he was familiar with the NHTSA standards for the walk and\nturn test and confirmed that the appellant was permitted to raise his arms six inches from his\nsides.\n\n       Officer Jones acknowledged that his report stated that the appellant took thirty-six\n\n                                               -7-\n\fseconds to complete the Romberg test. After extensive cross-examination, he further\nacknowledged that he timed the appellant during the test and that, on the video, he stated that\nthe appellant was “[d]ead on it.” He explained that, generally, he allowed about ten seconds\neither way because he believed that a few seconds’ variation was understandable. After\nwatching the video, Officer Jones said that the appellant took thirty-six seconds to perform\nthe test, noting that he “was given instructions at the beginning at 32 after. He stopped the\ntask[,] asked a question and began at 38 after.” Officer Jones acknowledged, however, that\nhe began timing when Sergeant Clouse first gave instructions to the appellant and that\nSergeant Clouse actually instructed the appellant twice. Officer Jones further acknowledged\nthat from the time of the second instruction, the appellant performed the test in thirty\nseconds.\n\n        After the conclusion of the proof, the jury found the appellant guilty of driving under\nthe influence (DUI), second offense; speeding; and violating the open container law. The\nappellant agreed to a total effective sentence of eleven months and twenty-nine days,\nsuspended after service of sixty days. On appeal, the appellant contends that the trial court\nerred by allowing the State to violate the rule of witness sequestration, that the trial court\nerred by sustaining the State’s objection to the appellant’s request to have Sergeant Clouse\ndemonstrate the Romberg test, and that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his\nconvictions.\n\n                                        II. Analysis\n\n                                 A. Witness Sequestration\n\n      The appellant contends that the trial court erred by allowing Officer Jones, the\nprosecuting officer, to testify as the State’s second witness in violation of Tennessee Rule\nof Evidence 615. The State acknowledges that Officer Jones should have testified first.\nHowever, the State argues that the appellant has failed to show prejudice.\n\n       Tennessee Rule of Evidence 615 is the rule of sequestration and is “colloquially\nreferred to as ‘The Rule.’” Neil P. Cohen et al., Tennessee Law of Evidence, § 6.15[2] (6th\ned. 2011). Rule 615 provides\n\n              At the request of a party the court shall order witnesses,\n              including rebuttal witnesses, excluded at trial or other\n              adjudicatory hearing. In the court’s discretion, the requested\n              sequestration may be effective before voir dire, but in any event\n              shall be effective before opening statements. The court shall\n              order all persons not to disclose by any means to excluded\n\n                                              -8-\n\f               witnesses any live trial testimony or exhibits created in the\n               courtroom by a witness. This rule does not authorize exclusion\n               of (1) a party who is a natural person, or (2) a person designated\n               by counsel for a party that is not a natural person, or (3) a person\n               whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the\n               presentation of the party’s cause. This rule does not forbid\n               testimony of a witness called at the rebuttal stage of a hearing if,\n               in the court’s discretion, counsel is genuinely surprised and\n               demonstrates a need for rebuttal testimony from an\n               unsequestered witness\n\nThe purpose of the rule of sequestration is to “prevent one witness from hearing the\ntestimony of another and adjusting his testimony accordingly.” State v. Harris, 839 S.W.2d\n54, 68 (Tenn. 1992). The rule may be invoked at any time and is mandatory upon its\ninvocation. See State v. Anthony, 836 S.W.2d 600, 605 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992).\n\n      Prior to the enactment of Tennessee Rule of Evidence 615 in 1991, our supreme court\nhad explained the following regarding the rule of sequestration:\n\n                       The attorney for the State has the right to such assistance\n               as the prosecutor can give him in the management of the State’s\n               case, and, upon his request, it is not error to permit the\n               prosecutor to remain in the courtroom after the rule has been\n               called for; but the court should impose as a condition that the\n               State, if it desires to use the prosecutor as a witness, should\n               examine him first. The action of the court in the present case in\n               declining to pursue this course was error, but, inasmuch as we\n               cannot see that any substantial injury was done to the defense of\n               the plaintiffs in error in the court below by such action, it cannot\n               be treated as reversible error in the present case.\n\nSmartt v. State, 80 S.W. 586, 588 (Tenn. 1903). In Mothershed v. State, 578 S.W.2d 96,\n100-01 (Tenn. 1978), the court, citing Smartt, reiterated that a police officer testifying as the\nState’s prosecuting witness is not subject to the rule but must testify first. More recently, this\ncourt explained,\n\n               “Smartt was decided when a testifying defendant was statutorily\n               required to be the first witness for the defense. See Clemons v.\n               State, 92 Tenn. 282, 21 S.W. 525 (1893). The rule in Smartt\n               created a symmetry by preventing either party from having the\n\n                                               -9-\n\f               advantage of a witness being able to conform his testimony with\n               that of other witnesses. See Brooks v. State, 406 U.S. 605, 611,\n               92 S. Ct. 1891. That symmetry was ended in Brooks when the\n               United States Supreme Court held that making the defendant\n               testify first or not at all violated the defendant’s right against\n               self-incrimination and right to due process. Id. 406 U.S. at 611\n               n.5.\n\n                      Although the defendant no longer need testify first, we\n               believe the Smartt rule generally remains in effect as shown in\n               Mothershed.”\n\nState v. Stephens, 264 S.W.3d 719, 738-39 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2007) (quoting State v. Timmy\nReagan, No. M2002-01472-CCA-R3-CD, 2004 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 452, at *50-51\n(Nashville, May 19, 2004)). “When a State’s designated representative does not testify first,\nthe Defendant is entitled to relief only if the Defendant can show prejudice as a result.” State\nv. Reginald Fowler, No. E2009-00293-CCA-R3-CD, 2010 Tenn. Crim. App. LEXIS 807,\nat *55 (Knoxville, Sept. 29, 2010) (citing Stephens, 264 S.W.3d at 739).\n\n        In the instant case, the State called for “the Rule” before opening statements.\nThereafter, the State designated Officer Ben Jones as the prosecuting witness. As its first\nwitness, the State called Sergeant Clouse. Defense counsel objected, arguing, “If Mr. Jones\nis going to be in the room then I would assert that he has to go first. I think the rules are\npretty clear on that. The State’s allowed to have the one officer here at the table with them,\nbut I do believe that person has to go first. And I would object to the order of this calling.”\nThe prosecutor responded, “I think that’s incorrect, Judge. I mean, I’m allowed a witness\nto sit at the table with me. I don’t have to call him first.” The trial court overruled the\nobjection and allowed the State to proceed.\n\n       At the motion for new trial, the prosecutor conceded that “the State should have called\nthe designated officer first. I think just doing the research, I think that’s correct.” The trial\ncourt acknowledged that it “miscalled it” by overruling the appellant’s objection.\n\n       On appeal, the appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing\nthe State to violate the rule of sequestration. The State concedes the error. Next, we must\ndetermine the effect of the error, mainly whether the appellant was prejudiced by the error.\n\n        Regarding prejudice, defense counsel contended at the motion for new trial that due\nto the sequestration violation, he was “forced . . . to alter [his] trial strategy” and that he was\nunable to cross-examine Sergeant Clouse the way he had intended or else he would “tip [his]\n\n                                               -10-\n\fhand to Officer Jones.” Defense counsel explained that if Officer Jones had not been in the\ncourtroom, he\n\n              would have done exactly what I did to Officer Jones – nine\n              pages of voir dire until he admitted that it was 30 seconds. That\n              he, in fact – that he had lied or was he mistaken or whatever,\n              Judge. I don’t know the answer to that, but I know that on that\n              tape, one of those, Officer Jones says he’s dead on it; and yet,\n              the police report said 36 seconds and it was filed just a couple\n              of hours later or shortly thereafter. So I couldn’t attack\n              [Sergeant Clouse] on that issue because Officer Jones is sitting\n              here.\n\nDefense counsel asserted that Sergeant Clouse’s “credibility was given a lot of weight by that\njury. And I wasn’t allowed to attack him on that issue.”\n\n       Defense counsel stated:\n\n              Had I challenged [Sergeant Clouse] and went through that voir\n              dire, Officer Jones would have changed his testimony right off\n              the bat and it would not have taken nine pages for him to get it\n              out. So that is exactly my basis that he’s talking about, that\n              Officer Jones’ testimony would have changed. Had I voir dired\n              [Sergeant Clouse] first, Officer Jones would have simply got on\n              the stand and I asked him the question, it was 30 seconds. He\n              didn’t do that. It took my nine pages of voir dire to get it out of\n              him. And that’s exactly my point.\n\n       The trial court responded:\n\n                     Well, I certainly understand your point of view and I\n              respect the vigor on which you argue on behalf of your client.\n              The fact is irrefutable, though, that the witness said it was 36\n              seconds. The video said it was 30 seconds. Ultimately, Jones\n              acknowledged it was 30 seconds. The jury clearly had the\n              testimony of [Sergeant Clouse] that it could juxtapose against\n              the actual count on the video and draw a conclusion as to\n              whether that should impair the credibility of [Sergeant Clouse].\n              You had the ability to argue as long and as hard as you wanted\n              to to the jury, you can’t believe what [Sergeant Clouse] said\n\n                                             -11-\n\f              because he sat right there and told you it was 36 seconds, and\n              you and I and everybody else in this courtroom have looked at\n              the video and we know it’s exactly 30 seconds.\n\n                     ....\n\n                      What was my error? My error was allowing a\n              representative of the State to sit at counsel table when that\n              person was not being called to testify first. The issue is whether\n              that error made a difference. What I’m suggesting to you is that\n              you made your point, in spades, that [Sergeant Clouse] said it\n              was 36 seconds. The video, without equivocation, said that the\n              Romberg test resulted in a 30-second count by your client, Mr.\n              Cooper. [Sergeant Clouse], therefore, either intentionally or\n              negligently misrepresented something when he testified on the\n              witness stand. That’s not lost on anybody in this courtroom or\n              at that trial. So while I was at error, I don’t see how it\n              prejudiced your client.\n\n       On appeal, the appellant contends that “it should be found that the testimony of\nOfficer Jones was likely influenced by hearing the testimony of his colleague Sergeant\nClouse. . . . The State asked Officer Jones to corroborate Sergeant Clouse’s testimony and\nOfficer Jones referred to what Sergeant Clouse described because he was able to listen to his\ntestimony.” The appellant insists that “[m]ost important for the defense was the planned\nimpact of the videotape to impeach each officer individually in front of the jury regarding the\npurported thirty-six seconds that the officers believed the Appellant took to count thirty\nseconds as part of the [R]omberg test.” The appellant contends that “the impact of\nimpeaching both officers immediately after each was examined directly was eliminated and\nthe effect of only showing that the lower ranking, less experienced Officer Jones was\nincorrect on that very important point greatly diminished the Appellant’s case.”\n\n        A leading treatise has suggested that in determining the proper sanction to be applied\nfor a violation of Rule 615, a court should consider the following non-exclusive factors: (1)\nthe harm caused by the violation; (2) the importance of the testimony by the witness who\nviolated the rule; and (3) the party at fault for the violation. Neil P. Cohen et al. Tennessee\nLaw of Evidence § 6.15[11][c] (LEXIS publishing, 6th ed. 2011). Regarding the first factor,\na court should consider whether the witness heard proof that could affect his or her testimony\nor whether the witness was exposed to unrelated proof. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -12-\n\f        In the instant case, only two witnesses testified; accordingly, their credibility was\nparamount. The significance of the witnesses’ testimony was made clear to the jury by the\nState’s opening statement, wherein the State urged the jury not to focus on the video, which\nin our view was at best inconclusive. Instead, the State asked the jury to focus on “the\ntotality of everything that you hear today. Focus on the driving. Focus on what the\n[appellant] says. How he says it. What he does. Focus on these officers[’] training and\nexperience and what they saw first-hand.” Moreover, during deliberations the jury asked to\nreview the video of the stop, indicating that the appellant’s performance on the field sobriety\ntests was a close question.\n\n        Further, because of the violation Officer Jones was allowed to hear the testimony of\nSergeant Clouse, his senior officer, regarding the very same questions he would be asked.\nIn fact, the State said that it did not need to question Officer Jones extensively regarding the\nfield sobriety tests because Sergeant Clouse had already testified about the tests. Regarding\nthe appellant’s performance of the Romberg test, Officer Jones testified consistently with\nSergeant Clouse concerning the time it took to complete the test. Officer Jones did not\nchange his testimony until he was repeatedly confronted on cross-examination with the video\nrecording of the tests, which reflected that on the night in question, he stated that the\nappellant was “dead on it” and had performed the test in the exact time allotted. The\nappellant’s cross-examination was vital to challenging the credibility of the State’s witnesses,\nand his defense was harmed by counsel having to make last minute changes to his trial\nstrategy which diminished the effect of his cross-examination. Accordingly, we conclude\nthat the harm was great.\n\n       Turning to the importance of the testimony, as we have noted, Officer Jones’s\ntestimony concerned the precise facts at issue at trial, namely indicators of the appellant’s\nintoxication. Third, a court should consider whether the violation was intentional or\naccidental. For example, “[i]f counsel offering the witness knew that the witness was in the\ncourtroom in violation of the sequestration order, more drastic sanctions . . . may be\nappropriate.” Id. Unquestionably, Officer Jones’s presence in the courtroom was due\nprimarily to the State’s incorrect argument regarding Rule 615. Based upon the foregoing,\nwe are unable to conclude that the error was harmless. Therefore, the appellant is entitled\nto a new trial.\n\n                                   B. Cross-Examination\n\n        As his next issue, the appellant asserts that the trial court erred by sustaining the\nState’s objection to the appellant’s request to have Sergeant Clouse perform the Romberg\nfield sobriety test. The appellant contends that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment\nright to confront witnesses by curtailing his cross-examination. In response, the State\n\n                                              -13-\n\fmaintains that the trial court’s ruling was correct.\n\n        The record reflects that on direct examination, Sergeant Clouse demonstrated, without\nobjection, the proper way to perform the one leg stand test. Additionally, Sergeant Clouse\nshowed the jury what he meant when he said that the appellant “flar[ed]” his arms,\n“cant[ed],” and walked in a small circle with “Bozo feet” during the walk and turn test. On\ncross-examination, defense counsel asked Sergeant Clouse if performing the Romberg test\nin thirty-six seconds was “bad.” Sergeant Clouse responded, “It’s not 30 seconds.” At that\npoint, defense counsel asked Sergeant Clouse to close his eyes. The State objected to the\nrelevance of the request, and Defense counsel responded, “Judge, I want to see if he can do\nit.” The State argued that the officer’s ability to perform the test correctly was not relevant\nto establish whether the appellant properly performed the test. Defense counsel countered,\n“Judge, it’s relevant to whether anybody can do it.” The trial court sustained the State’s\nobjection, stating, “The only issue is your client and whether he could comply with the\ninstructions.”\n\n        A defendant’s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him includes the\nright to conduct meaningful cross-examination. Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 51\n(1987); State v. Brown, 29 S.W.3d 427, 430-31 (Tenn. 2000). Denial of a defendant’s right\nto effective cross-examination is “‘constitutional error of the first magnitude’” and may\nviolate the defendant’s right to a fair trial. State v. Hill, 598 S.W.2d 815, 819 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp. 1980) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 318 (1974)). “The propriety, scope,\nmanner and control of the cross-examination of witnesses, however, rests within the\ndiscretion of the trial court.” State v. Dishman, 915 S.W.2d 458, 463 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1995). Furthermore, “a defendant’s right to confrontation does not preclude a trial court\nfrom imposing limits upon cross-examination which take into account such factors as\nharassment, prejudice, issue confusion, witness safety, or merely repetitive or marginally\nrelevant interrogation.” State v. Reid, 882 S.W.2d 423, 430 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994).\nFurther, a defendant’s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses “does not mean that a\ndefendant has a right to present irrelevant evidence.” State v. Sheline, 955 S.W.2d 42, 47\n(Tenn. 1997). We will not disturb the limits that a trial court has placed upon\ncross-examination unless the court has unreasonably restricted the right. Dishman, 915\nS.W.2d at 463.\n\n       Generally, whether to allow a courtroom demonstration is a matter that rests within\nthe sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\ndiscretion. State v. Underwood, 669 S.W.2d 700, 704 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1984). This court\nhas further instructed that “‘[d]emonstrative evidence is admissible only if relevant under\n[Tenn. R. Evid.] 401.’” State v. Coulter, 67 S.W.3d 3, (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001) (quoting\nRonald Bradford Waller v. State, No. E1999-02034-CCA-R3-PC, 2000 Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n                                             -14-\n\fLEXIS 558, at *45 (Knoxville, July 18, 2000)). “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having\nany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination\nof the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Tenn.\nR. Evid. 401; see also State v. Kennedy, 7 S.W.3d 58, 68 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1999).\nTennessee Rule of Evidence 402 provides that “[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible except\nas [otherwise] provided . . . . Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.” The trial\ncourt has the discretion to determine whether the proffered evidence is relevant; thus, we will\nnot overturn the trial court’s decision absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Forbes, 918\nS.W.2d 431, 449 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995).\n\n        At the motion for new trial hearing, defense counsel argued that he wanted the jury\nto see whether Sergeant Clouse was capable of performing the Romberg test within the\nallotted time frame. In his brief, the appellant explained that he wanted to compare the\nappellant’s performance with Sergeant Clouse’s. The trial court observed that “what\nconcerns me is that the officer is not on trial. [The appellant] was on trial. The officer may\nbe a completely competent officer but have a club foot, could do a nine-step walk and turn\nif he had to. . . . You know, or it could be that he’s a completely competent officer and he\ncan’t count to 30. . . . [I]t concerns me that in requiring law enforcement to demonstrate\nthese tests, or take the tests at the request of defense counsel, that I am, in essence, putting\nthe law enforcement officer on trial as opposed to the person accused of a crime.” The trial\ncourt asserted that the issue was not whether Sergeant Clouse could perform the test but\nwhether the appellant could perform the test. We agree with the trial court that Sergeant\nClouse’s ability to perform the test was not relevant to the appellant’s ability to perform the\ntest. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting\nthe test.\n\n                               C. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n      Finally, the appellant argues that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain his DUI\nconviction. In response, the State asserts that the evidence is sufficient.\n\n       On appeal, a jury conviction removes the presumption of the appellant’s innocence\nand replaces it with one of guilt, so that the appellant carries the burden of demonstrating to\nthis court why the evidence will not support the jury’s findings. See State v. Tuggle, 639\nS.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). The appellant must establish that no reasonable trier of fact\ncould have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e).\n\n      Accordingly, on appeal, the State is entitled to the strongest legitimate view of the\nevidence and all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom. See State v.\n\n                                              -15-\n\fWilliams, 657 S.W.2d 405, 410 (Tenn. 1983). In other words, questions concerning the\ncredibility of witnesses and the weight and value to be given the evidence, as well as all\nfactual issues raised by the evidence, are resolved by the trier of fact, and not the appellate\ncourts. See State v. Pruett, 788 S.W.2d 559, 561 (Tenn. 1990).\n\n       The guilt of a defendant, including any fact required to be proven, may be predicated\nupon direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or a combination of both direct and\ncircumstantial evidence. See State v. Pendergrass, 13 S.W.3d 389, 392-93 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1999). Even though convictions may be established by different forms of evidence, the\nstandard of review for the sufficiency of that evidence is the same whether the conviction is\nbased upon direct or circumstantial evidence. See State v. Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d 370, 379\n(Tenn. 2011).\n\n        Tennessee Code Annotated section 55-10-401(a)(1), the DUI statute, provides, in\npertinent part, that “[i]t is unlawful for any person to drive or to be in physical control of any\nautomobile or other motor vehicle on any of the public roads and highways of the state . . .\nor any other premises frequented by the public at large, while [u]nder the influence of any\nintoxicant[.]” The proof at trial revealed that the appellant was stopped after he was\nobserved driving fifty-five miles per hour in a forty-mile-per-hour zone and failing to stop\nat a red light. After the officers stopped the appellant and approached his vehicle, they saw\nan open bottle of beer in the console. The bottle was cold and had condensation on the side.\nSergeant Clouse asked the appellant if he had been drinking, and the appellant responded that\nhe had consumed two beers. When the appellant exited his vehicle, both officers smelled\nalcohol on the appellant and saw that his eyes were bloodshot and watery. After arresting\nthe appellant for DUI, Sergeant Clouse again questioned the appellant about his drinking.\nThe appellant then admitted, “‘Oh, okay, yeah, okay, whatever, all right. I had three beers\ninstead of two, okay, I lied.’” The officers searched the vehicle and found a twelve-pack\ncarton of cold beer that had five cans missing. The jury heard the officers’ testimony, the\nextensive cross-examination, and viewed the video of the field sobriety tests before finding\nthat the appellant was intoxicated. We conclude that the evidence is sufficient for a\nreasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of DUI.\n\n                                       III. Conclusion\n\n      In sum, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to sustain the appellant’s\nconvictions and that the trial court did not err by failing to permit defense counsel to ask\nSergeant Clouse to perform the Romberg test. However, the violation of the rule of witness\nsequestration was reversible error; accordingly, we reverse the appellant’s conviction and\nremand for retrial.\n\n\n\n                                              -16-\n\f       _________________________________\n       NORMA McGEE OGLE, JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n-17-\n\f"

The number of colorings of knot diagrams by quandle elements, in particular, has been widely used as a knot invariant. Algebraic homology theories for quandles were defined [@CJKLS; @FRS1], and investigated. Knot invariants using cocycles have been defined [@CJKLS] and applied to knots and knotted surfaces [@CKS]. Extensions of quandles by cocycles have been studied, for example, in [@AG; @CENS; @Eis3].\n\nComputations by Vendramin [@Leandro] significantly expanded the list of small connected quandles. These quandles, called here [*Rig*]{} quandles, may be found in the  package Rig [@rig]. Rig includes all connected quandles of order less than 48, at this time. Properties of some of Rig quandles, such as homology groups and cocycle invariants, are also found in [@rig]. We use the notation $Q(n,i)$ for the $i$-th quandle of order $n$ in the list of Rig quandles.\n\nIt was observed that some Rig quandles have non-trivial second cohomology, yet have constant $2$-cocycle invariants with non-trivial $2$-cocycles, as much as computer calculations have been performed for the knot table (Remark 4.5, [@CSV]). It does not seem to have been established previously whether they actually have constant values for all classical knots. From Theorem 5.5 in [@CKS:geom], any non-trivial $2$-cocycle has non-constant invariant values for some virtual links. Thus it is of interest if these quandles actually have constant values for all classical knots. More generally, possible values of the cocycle invariants are largely unknown, and are of interest. In this paper, we show that certain algebraic properties of quandles imply that the cocycle invariant is constant, or takes some restricted form, for classical knots. In particular, we prove that several specific Rig quandles, including some of those conjectured in [@CSV], have constant cocycle invariant values for all classical knots for some non-trivial $2$-cocycles.\n\nIn Section \\[sec:prelim\\], definitions, terminology and lemmas are presented. The main results and corollaries, and their proofs are given in Section \\[sec:main\\]. Conjugation quandles are discussed in Sections \\[sec:conj\\] and \\[sec:VC\\]. Relations among various epimorphisms used in the proofs are examined in Secition \\[sec:rel\\].\n\nPreliminaries {#sec:prelim}\n=============\n\nIn this section we briefly review some definitions and examples. More details can be found, for example, in [@CKS].\n\nA [*quandle*]{} $X$ is a set with a binary operation $(a, b) \\mapsto a * b$ satisfying the following conditions. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\mbox{\\rm (Idempotency) } & &  \\mbox{\\rm  For any $a \\in X$,\n$a* a =a$.} \\label{axiom1} \\\\\n\\mbox{\\rm (Right invertibility)}& & \\mbox{\\rm For any $b,c \\in X$, there is a unique $a \\in X$ such that \n$ a*b=c$.} \\label{axiom2} \\\\\n\\mbox{\\rm (Right self-distributivity)} & & \n\\mbox{\\rm For any $a,b,c \\in X$, we have\n$ (a*b)*c=(a*c)*(b*c). $} \\label{axiom3} \\end{aligned}$$ A [*quandle homomorphism*]{} between two quandles $X, Y$ is a map $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ such that $f(x*_X y)=f(x) *_Y f(y) $, where $*_X$ and $*_Y$ denote the quandle operations of $X$ and $Y$, respectively. A [*quandle isomorphism*]{} is a bijective quandle homomorphism, and two quandles are [*isomorphic*]{} if there is a quandle isomorphism between them. A quandle epimorphism $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ is a [*covering*]{} [@Eis3] if $f(x)=f(y)$ implies $a*x=a*y$ for all $a, x, y \\in X$.\n\nLet $X$ be a quandle. The [*right translation*]{} ${R}_a:X \\rightarrow  X$, by $a \\in X$, is defined by ${ R}_a(x) = x*a$ for $x \\in X$. Then ${ R}_a$ is an automorphism of $X$ by Axioms (2) and (3). The subgroup of ${\\rm Sym}(X)$ generated by the permutations ${ R}_a$, $a \\in X$, is called the [*[inn]{}er automorphism group*]{} of $X$, and is denoted by ${\\rm Inn}(X)$. The map ${\\rm inn}: X \\rightarrow {\\rm inn}(X) \\subset {\\rm Inn}(X)$ defined by ${\\rm inn}(x)=R_x$ is called the [*inner representation*]{}. An inner representation is a covering.\n\nA quandle is [*connected*]{} if ${\\rm Inn}(X)$ acts transitively on $X$. A quandle is [*faithful*]{} if the mapping ${\\rm inn}: X \\rightarrow  {\\rm Inn}(X)$ is an injection.\n\nAs in Joyce [@Joyce] a quandle is defined by a pair $(G, f)$ where $G$ is a group, $f \\in {\\rm Aut}(G)$, and the quandle operation is defined by $x*y=f(xy^{-1}) y ,$ $ x,y \\in G$. We call such a quandle a [*generalized Alexander quandle*]{} and denote it by ${\\rm GAlex}(G,f)$. If $G$ is abelian, such a quandle is known as an [*Alexander quandle*]{}.\n\nIn this paper all quandles are assumed to be finite.\n\n![Colored crossings and cocycle weights []{data-label=\"coloredXing\"}](coloredXing1.eps \"fig:\"){width=\"3in\"}\\\n\nLet $D$ be a diagram of a knot $K$, and ${\\cal A}(D)$ be the set of arcs of $D$. A [*coloring*]{} of a knot diagram $D$ by a quandle $X$ is a map $C: {\\cal A}(D) \\rightarrow X$ satisfying the condition depicted in Figure \\[coloredXing\\] at every positive (left) and negative (right) crossing $\\tau$, respectively. The pair $(x_\\tau, y_\\tau)$ of colors assigned to a pair of nearby arcs of a crossing $\\tau$ is called the [*source*]{} colors, and the third arc is required to receive the color $x_\\tau * y_\\tau$.\n\nIn this paper we denote by $A$ a finite multiplicative abelian group whose identity element is denoted by $1$. A function $\\phi: X \\times X \\rightarrow A$ for an abelian group $A$ is called a *quandle $2$-cocycle* [@CJKLS] if it satisfies $$\\phi (x, y)\n    \\phi(x,z)^{-1}  \\phi(x*y, z)  \\phi(x*z, y*z)^{-1}=1$$ for any $x,y,z \\in X$ and $\\phi(x,x)=1$ for any $x\\in X$. For a quandle $2$-cocycle $\\phi$, $E=X \\times A$ becomes a quandle by setting $$(x, a) * (y, b)=(x*y, a\\, \\phi(x,y))$$ for $x, y \\in X$, $a,b \\in A$, denoted by $E(X, A, \\phi)$ or simply $E(X, A)$, and it is called an *abelian extension* of $X$ by $A$. Let $\\pi: E (X, A) = X \\times A \\rightarrow X$ be the projection to the first factor. We also say that a quandle epimorphism $f: Y \\rightarrow Z$ is an [*abelian extension*]{} if there exists a isomorphisms $\\nu:  E(X, A)  \\rightarrow Y$ and $h: X \\rightarrow Z$ such that $ h \\pi= f  \\nu$. An abelian extension is a covering. See [@CENS] for more information on abelian extensions of quandles and [@CJKLS; @CJKS; @CJKS2] for more on quandle cohomology.\n\nLet $X$ be a quandle, and $\\phi$ be a $2$-cocycle with coefficient group $A$, a finite abelian group. Let $D$ be a diagram of a knot $K$. The $2$-cocycle (or cocycle, for short) invariant is an element of the group ring ${{\\mathbb Z}}[A]$ defined by $\\Phi_{(X,A,\\phi)} (D) =\\Phi_{\\phi} (D)= \\sum_{C} \\prod_{\\tau} \\phi(x_\\tau, y_\\tau)^{\\epsilon(\\tau)}$, where the product ranges over all crossings $\\tau$, the sum ranges over all colorings of a given knot diagram, $(x_\\tau, y_\\tau)$ are source colors at the crossing $\\tau$, and $\\epsilon(\\tau)$ is the sign of $\\tau$ as specified in Figure \\[coloredXing\\]. For a given coloring $C$, the element $\\prod_{\\tau} \\phi(x_\\tau, y_\\tau)^{\\epsilon(\\tau)} \\in A$ is denoted by $B_\\phi (D, C) $. For an abelian group $A$, the cocycle invariant takes the form $\\sum_{a \\in A} n_a a$ where $n_a \\in {{\\mathbb Z}}$, and it is [*constant*]{} if $n_a=0$ when $a$ is not the identity of $A$. It is known [@CJKLS] that $\\Phi_\\phi (D)$ is independent of choice of diagram $D$ for a knot $K$. Thus we have the [*2-cocycle invariant*]{} $\\Phi_{(X,A, \\phi )}(K) = \\Phi_{ \\phi }(K) = \\Phi_\\phi(D)$.\n\nA $1$-tangle is a properly embedded arc in a $3$-ball, and the equivalence of $1$-tangles is defined by ambient isotopies of the $3$-ball fixing the boundary (cf. [@Conway]). A diagram of a $1$-tangle is defined in a manner similar to a knot diagram, from a regular projection to a disk by specifying crossing information, see Figure \\[tangles\\](A). An orientation of a $1$-tangle is specified by an arrow on a diagram as depicted. A knot diagram is obtained from a $1$-tangle diagram by closing the end points by a trivial arc outside of a disk. This procedure is called the [*closure*]{} of a $1$-tangle. If a $1$-tangle is oriented, then the closure inherits the orientation. Two diagrams of the same $1$-tangle are related by Reidemeister moves. There is a bijection between knots and $1$-tangles for classical knots, and invariants of 1-tangles give rise to invariants of knots, see [@Eis3], for example.\n\n![ $1$-tangles []{data-label=\"tangles\"}](tangles.eps \"fig:\"){width=\"2.7in\"}\\\n\nA $1$-tangle is obtained from a knot $K$ as follows. Choose a base point $b\n\\in K$ and a small closed ball neighborhood $B$ of $b$ in the $3$-sphere ${\\mathbb{S}}^3$ such that $(B, K\\cap B)$ is a trivial ball-arc pair (so that $K \\cap B$ is unknotted in $B$, see Figure \\[tangles\\](B)). Then $({\\mathbb{S}}^3 \\setminus {\\rm\nInt}(B), K \\cap ({\\mathbb{S}}^3 \\setminus {\\rm Int}(B)))$ is a $1$-tangle called the $1$-tangle associated with $K$. The resulting $1$-tangle does not depend on the choice of a base point. If a knot is oriented, then the corresponding $1$-tangle inherits the orientation.\n\nA quandle coloring of an oriented $1$-tangle diagram is defined in a manner similar to those for knots. We do not require that the end points receive the same color for a quandle coloring of $1$-tangle diagrams. As in [@CSV] we say that a quandle $X$ is [*end monochromatic*]{} for a tangle diagram $T$ if any coloring of $T$ by $X$ assigns the same color on the two end arcs. We use the same notations $\\Phi_{\\phi} (T) = \\sum_{\\cal C} \\prod_{\\tau} \\phi(x_\\tau, y_\\tau)^{\\epsilon(\\tau)}$ and $B_\\phi (T, C) $ for tangle diagrams $T$. This $\\Phi_{\\phi} (T)$ is again independent of choice of a diagram, and an invariant of tangles. Figures \\[coloredXing\\], \\[tangles\\], \\[endmono\\] are taken from [@CSV].\n\n![ Colorings of a tangle []{data-label=\"endmono\"}](endmono1.eps \"fig:\"){width=\"1.1in\"}\\\n\nWe recall the following two lemmas.\n\n\\[lem:cover\\] Let $f: Y \\rightarrow X$ be a covering, and $C_X: {\\cal A} (T) \\rightarrow X$ be a coloring of a $1$-tangle $T$ by $X$. Let $b_0, b_1$ be the top and bottom arcs as depicted in Figure \\[endmono\\]. Then for any $y \\in Y $ such that $f(y)=C_X(b_0)$, there exists a unique coloring $C_Y: {\\cal A} (T) \\rightarrow Y$ such that $f  C_Y=C_X$ and $C_Y(b_0)=y$.\n\n\\[lem:const\\] Let $E=E(X, A, \\phi)$ be an abelian extension for a $2$-cocycle $\\phi$. Then $E$ is end monochromatic $T$ if and only if $\\Phi_{(X, A, \\phi)}(K)$ is constant, where $T$ is a $1$-tangle for a knot $K$.\n\n\\[lem:end\\] Let $C:  {\\cal A} (T) \\rightarrow Y$ be a coloring of a classical $1$-tangle diagram $T$ by a quandle $Y$. For the top and bottom arcs $b_0$ and $b_1$ of $T$, respectively, let $y_0=C(b_0)$ and $y_1=C(b_1)$. Then ${\\rm inn}(y_0)=R_{y_0}=R_{y_1}={\\rm inn}(y_1)$.\n\nThe proof in [@CSV], based on corresponding statements in [@Nos; @Jozef; @Jozef2004] on faithful quandles, applies in this situation. The idea of proof is seen in Figure \\[endmono\\]. The large circle behind the tangle $T$ in the figure can be pulled out of $T$ if $T$ corresponds to a classical knot. Colorings of tangle diagrams can be defined when a tangle has more than one component, in a similar manner. Hence any color $y$ at the left of the large circle should extend to the color to the right, so that for the colors $y_0$ and $y_1$ for the top and bottom arcs $b_0$ and $b_1$ must satisfy $y*y_0=y*y_1$, hence we obtain $R_{y_0}=R_{y_1}$.\n\n![ Long virtual knots []{data-label=\"virtualize\"}](virtualize.eps \"fig:\"){width=\"3.5in\"}\\\n\n[To see that the condition of being a classical knot is essential, we observe examples of [*long virtual knots*]{} (i.e., virtual $1$-tangles) for which the conclusion of Lemma \\[lem:end\\] does not hold. See [@Man], for example, for long virtual knots. Colorings of oriented virtual (and long virtual) knots are defined in a manner similar to classical knots, with colors unchanged for each transverse arc at each virtual crossing [@Kauff]. Suppose a (virtual or classical) knot diagram $D$ is colored non-trivially by a faithful quandle $X$, and let $\\tau$ be a non-trivially colored crossing (that is, distinct colors appear at $\\tau$). Since $X$ is faithful, all three colors at $\\tau$ are distinct (see Figure \\[virtualize\\](A) left). Make $\\tau$ a virtual crossing (called [*virtualization of a crossing*]{}) as in the middle of (A), and cut and prolong one of the under-arcs up and down, to make a long virtual knot (a virtual $1$-tangle), as in (A) right. A cut point is indicated by a dot in (A) middle. Prolonged arcs cross other arcs by virtual crossings. Then the top and bottom arcs are colored by elements $a, c \\in X$ such that $R_a \\neq R_c$. Thus the resulting long virtual knot is not classical. An example of this construction is illustrated in Figure \\[virtualize\\](B) with a Fox tri-coloring. The quandle used here is ${{\\mathbb Z}}_3$ with $a*b=2b-a$ mod 3, a well known [*dihedral*]{} quandle of order 3, which is faithful. ]{}\n\n Cocycle invariants and the images of inner representations  {#sec:main}\n============================================================\n\nIn this section we present relations between certain algebraic properties of quandles and values of the quandle cocycle invariant. We do not assume connectivity of quandles in this section unless otherwise specified.\n\n\\[thm:main\\] Let $E=E(X,A,\\phi)$ be an abelian extension of a quandle $X$. If $E \\cong {\\rm inn}(Y)$ for some quandle $Y$, then $\\Phi_{(X,A,\\phi)}(K)$ is constant for all classical knots $K$.\n\nLet $T$ be a $1$-tangle of $K$, $b_0, b_1$ be the top and bottom arcs of $T$, respectively. Let $C$ be a coloring of a diagram of $K$ by $X$, and use the same notation $C: {\\cal A}(T) \\rightarrow X$ for a corresponding coloring of $T$ such that $C(b_0)=C(b_1)=x \\in X$. Then $C$ extends to a coloring $C_E: {\\cal A}(T) \\rightarrow E$ by Lemma \\[lem:cover\\].\n\nRecall that the inner representation is a covering. Without loss of generality, we assume that ${\\rm inn}(Y)=E$. By assumption and Lemma \\[lem:cover\\], $C_E$ extends to a coloring $C_Y$. Since $E$ is an abelian extension of $X$, Lemma \\[lem:const\\] and Lemma \\[lem:end\\] imply that the cocycle invariant is constant.\n\nTo apply the theorem to some Rig quandles, we observe the following.\n\n\\[lem:order2\\] If ${\\rm inn} : Y \\rightarrow {\\rm inn}(Y)= X$, for connected quandles $X$ and $Y$, satisfies $|Y|/|X|=2$, then ${\\rm inn}$ is an abelian extension.\n\nFor ${\\rm inn}: Y \\rightarrow {\\rm inn}(Y)=X$, where $X$ and $Y$ are connected quandles, it is proved in [@AG] that there is a quandle isomorphism $\\nu :  X \\times S  \\rightarrow Y$ for a set $S$, such that $\\pi={\\rm inn} ( \\nu) $ for the projection $\\pi: X \\times S \\rightarrow X$. The quandle operation on $X \\times S$ is defined by $$(x, s)*(y, t) = (x*y, \\beta_{x,y} (s) )\\quad {\\rm for } \\quad (x, s), (y, t) \\in X \\times S,$$ for some $\\beta: X^2 \\rightarrow {\\rm Sym}(S)$. The proof of Theorem 7.1 of [@CSV] shows that if the cardinality of $S$ is 2, then we can assume $S={{\\mathbb Z}}_2$ and $\\beta_{x, y}(a) = a\\, \\phi (x,y)$ where $\\phi$ is a $2$-cocycle with coefficient group $A={{\\mathbb Z}}_2$. Hence ${\\rm inn}$ is an abelian extension.\n\nWe say that an epimorphism $f: Y \\rightarrow X$ is [*of index $k$*]{} if $|Y|/|X|=k$. Note that if $Y$ is connected, then each fiber $f^{-1}(x)$, $x \\in X$, has cardinality $k$.\n\n\\[cor:rig\\] The following Rig quandles have non-trivial second cohomology groups with the coefficient group $A={{\\mathbb Z}}_2$, yet give rise to constant quandle $2$-cocycle invariants for any classical knot with the corresponding non-trivial $2$-cocycles: $$\\begin{array}{llllllll}\n  Q(6,1),&  Q(10,1), &  \nQ(12, 5), & Q(12, 6), &  Q(12, 7), & Q(12, 8), & \n Q(16,4), &\n  Q(16,5), \\\\\n  Q(16,6), & \n Q(18, 1), &  \n   Q(18, 2), &  \n    Q(18, 8), &  \n   Q(18, 9), &  Q(18, 10), & \n      Q(24, 3), &\n      Q(24, 4), \\\\\n    Q(24, 13), &  \n Q(24, 22),  &  \n Q(30, 2), &  Q(30, 7), &   \n  Q(30, 8), & \nQ(40, 8), & \n Q(40, 9), &    Q(40, 10), \\\\  \nQ(42, 1), &  Q(42, 3), &  Q(42, 4), &  Q(42, 7), &  Q(42, 8). & & & \n\\end{array}$$\n\nComputer calculations show the following quandle sequences of Rig quandles: $$\\begin{array}{rllll}\n Q(24,1)& \\stackrel{{\\rm inn}}{\\longrightarrow} & Q(12,1) & \\stackrel{{\\rm inn}}{\\longrightarrow} & Q(6,1),  \\\\\n  Q(40,2) &\\stackrel{{\\rm inn}}{\\longrightarrow} &  Q(20, 3)  & \\stackrel{{\\rm inn}}{\\longrightarrow}&  Q(10,1) . \\\\\n\\end{array}$$ For example, the first sequence shows that $Q(12, 1)$ is an abelian extension of $Q(6,1)$ by a cocycle $\\phi$, and is the image of $Q(24,1)$ by ${\\rm inn}$. Then Lemma \\[lem:order2\\] and Theorem \\[thm:main\\] imply that $\\Phi_\\phi (K)$ is constant for all classical knots $K$.

The right-most quandle in each sequence is faithful, so the sequences cannot be extended non-trivially to the right with inner representations. The notation $R(n, j)$ is used to indicate a quandle of order $n$ when $n >  47$ and hence not a Rig quandle. The index $j$ is simply to distinguish non-isomorphic quandles.\n\nTerminating sequences of ${\\rm inn}$, $$X=X_0 \\stackrel{{\\rm inn}}{\\longrightarrow} X_1={\\rm inn}(X_0) \\stackrel{{\\rm inn}}{\\longrightarrow} \\cdots\n \\stackrel{{\\rm inn}}{\\longrightarrow} X_n={\\rm inn}(X_{n-1}) ,$$ are discussed in [@AG], where $X_n$ is faithful and $X_j$ are not, for $j=1, \\ldots, n-1$. For the 790 Rig quandles of order less than 48, there are 66 non-faithful quandles $X$, and all but two have faithful images ${\\rm inn}(X)$. The two exceptions are the above first two Rig quandles $Q(24, 1)$ and $Q(40, 2)$ in Corollary \\[cor:rig\\].\n\nOn the other hand, Tables \\[table:4term\\] and \\[table:short\\] include many quandles $X$ with ${\\rm inn}(X)$ being non-faithful Rig quandles.\n\nLet $X=Q(12, 5)$ or $Q(12,6)$. Then the second quandle cohomology group $H^2_Q(X,{{\\mathbb Z}}_4)$ is known [@rig] to be isomorphic to ${{\\mathbb Z}}_4$. See [@CJKLS; @CKS], for example, for details on quandle cohomology. Let $\\psi: X \\times X \\rightarrow {{\\mathbb Z}}_4$ be a $2$-cocycle which represents a generator of $H^2_Q(X,{{\\mathbb Z}}_4)\\cong {{\\mathbb Z}}_4$. Let $u$ denote a multiplicative generator of $A={{\\mathbb Z}}_4$. The cocycle invariants $\\Phi_\\psi(K)$ for $X=Q(12, 5)$ or $Q(12,6)$ with respect to $\\psi$, computed for some knots in the table in [@rig] up to 9 crossing knots, contain non-constant values, while for $A={{\\mathbb Z}}_2$ the invariant is constant by Corollary \\[cor:rig\\]. This is explained by the following.\n\nLet $X$ be a quandle and $n, m, d>1$ be positive integers such that $n=md$. Let $\\psi$ be a $2$-cocycle of $X$ with values in ${{\\mathbb Z}}_n$, and $\\Phi_\\psi(K)= \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j(K)\\,  u^j $ be the cocycle invariant of a knot $K$ with respect to $\\psi$.\n\nLet $E=E(X, {{\\mathbb Z}}_m, \\phi) \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow} X$ be the abelian extension corresponding to $\\phi=\\psi^d$, and suppose that there is a sequence of quandles $Y \\stackrel{\\rm inn}{\\longrightarrow} E \\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightarrow} X$. Then $a_k (K)=0$ for all $k$ that are not divisible by $m$, for any classical knot $K$.\n\nFor each coloring $C: {\\cal A}(T) \\rightarrow X$, the weight $\\phi(x_\\tau, y_\\tau )^{\\epsilon (\\tau) }$ at a crossing $\\tau$ for $\\phi$ is equal to $\\psi(x_\\tau, y_\\tau )^{d \\epsilon (\\tau) }$. Hence if $B_\\psi(T, C)= u^j$, then we have $B_\\phi(T, C)= u^{dj}$. Then $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi_\\phi(K) &=&  \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j(K)\\, u^{dj} \\\\\n&=& [ \\, \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} a_{mk} (K)  \\, ] \\, u^0 +\n[ \\, \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} a_{1+mk} (K)  \\, ] \\, u^d + \\cdots \\\\\n& & + \\  [ \\, \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} a_{\\ell + mk} (K)  \\, ] \\, u^{d \\ell}  + \\cdots + \\,\n[ \\, \\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} a_{(d-1)d + mk} (K)  \\, ] \\, u^{ d (d-1) } .\\end{aligned}$$ By Theorem \\[thm:main\\], this is equal to a constant, $\\sum_{k=0}^{d-1} \\, [ \\, a_{mk} (K)  \\, ] \\, u^0$. Since $a_j(K)$ are non-negative integers, the result follows.\n\nThe following solves a conjecture stated in [@CSV].\n\n\\[cor:Z4\\] Let $X=Q(12, 5)$ or $Q(12,6)$, and $\\psi: X \\times X \\rightarrow A={{\\mathbb Z}}_4$ be a $2$-cocycle which represents a generator of $H^2_Q(X,{{\\mathbb Z}}_4)\\cong {{\\mathbb Z}}_4$. Let $\\Phi_\\psi(K)= \\sum_{j=0}^3 a_j(K)\\, u^j \\in {{\\mathbb Z}}[A]$ be the cocycle invariant. Then $a_1(K)=a_3(K)=0$ for any classical knot $K$.\n\nThis situation is also found for $X=Q(18,1)$ or $Q(18,8)$, where $H^2_Q(X,{{\\mathbb Z}}_6)\\cong {{\\mathbb Z}}_6$. Let $u$ be a multiplicative generator of $A={{\\mathbb Z}}_6$. Then the invariant values are restricted to the following form.\n\n\\[cor:Z6\\] Let $X=Q(18, 1)$ or $Q(18,8)$, and $\\psi: X \\times X \\rightarrow {{\\mathbb Z}}_6$ be a $2$-cocycle which represents a generator of $H^2_Q(X,{{\\mathbb Z}}_6)\\cong {{\\mathbb Z}}_6$. Let $\\Phi_\\psi(K)= \\sum_{j=0}^5 a_j(K)\\, u^j \\in {{\\mathbb Z}}[A]$ be the cocycle invariant. Then $a_k(K)=0$ for $k=1,3,5$ for any classical knot $K$.\n\nThe cocycle invariant for connected quandles of order 18 are computed in [@rig] for up to 7 crossing knots at the time of writing. The invariant values for $Q(18,8)$ do contain non-constant values. For $Q(18,1)$, the invariant is constant, and we do not know whether this is an artifact of limited number of knots or it is constant for all classical knots.\n\nTheorem \\[thm:main\\] can be applied contrapositively: if $E \\rightarrow X$ is an abelian extension with a $2$-cocycle $\\phi$ such that $\\Phi_\\phi(K)$ is not constant for a classical knot $K$, then there is no finite quandle $Y$ such that ${\\rm inn}(Y)=E$ for the inner representation ${\\rm inn}$. Thus we obtain the following from [@Edwin] and [@rig]. The list contains abelian extension $E(X,{{\\mathbb Z}}_2, \\phi)$ such that $\\Phi_\\phi(K)$ is non-constant for some knot $K$ in the table. The list is from the information available at the time of writing.\n\n\\[cor:no-inn\\] For the following Rig quandles $E$, there is no finite quandle $Y$ such that ${\\rm inn}(Y)=E$ for the inner representation ${\\rm inn}$: $$Q(8,1),  \\ Q(24,1), \\ Q(24, 7), \\ Q(32, 1). \\ $$\n\nThe arguments in Corollary \\[cor:Z4\\] can be applied contrapositively to obtain the following as well.\n\n\\[cor:noY\\] Let $E$ be one of the Rig quandles $ Q(12,2)$, $Q(36,1)$ or $Q(32,9)$. Then there is no finite quandle $Y$ such that ${\\rm inn}(Y)=E$ for the inner representation ${\\rm inn}$.\n\nEach of the Rig quandles $Q(6,2)$, $Q(16,1)$, $Q(16, 7)$ has the second cohomology group isomorphic to ${{\\mathbb Z}}_4$. It is computed in [@Edwin] that the index 2 abelian extensions corresponding to $\\psi^2$ for a 2-cocycle $\\psi$ representing a generator of the second cohomology group are, respectively, $Q(12,2)$, $ Q(36,1)$, and $Q(32,9)$.\n\nLet $E$ be one of $Q(12,2)$, $ Q(36,1)$, and $Q(32,9)$. If there is a finite quandle $Y$ such that ${\\rm inn}(Y)=E$, then by the proof of Corollary \\[cor:Z4\\], the cocycle invariant $\\Phi_\\psi(K)= \\sum_{j=0}^{3} a_j(K)\\, u^{j} $ satisfies $a_1(K)=a_3(K)=0$ for all classical knots $K$. However, this is not the case from [@rig], and the result follows.\n\n[Similar arguments apply to other Rig quandles for $Q$ with cyclic second cohomology groups, but the corresponding index 2 abelian extensions go out of bounds of Rig quandles, and we are not able to specify the quandles with this property. However, we can conclude that for each Rig quandle $Q$ in the list given below, there is a non-trivial abelian extension $\\alpha: X \\rightarrow Q$ of index $2$ with the property that there is no finite quandle $Y$ such that ${\\rm inn}(Y)=X$ for the inner representation ${\\rm inn}$: $$Q(18,3), \\\nQ(18,6), \\  Q(18,7), \\\nQ(12, 10), \\ \nQ(12, 3),\\ \nQ(18,5).$$ ]{}\n\n$\\Phi_{(X,A,\\phi)}(K)$ is constant if $E(X,A,\\phi)$ is a conjugation quandle {#sec:conj}\n============================================================================\n\nLet $G$ be a finite group. For $a,b \\in G$ we write $a^b = b^{-1}ab$ and denote the conjugacy class of $G$ containing $x$ by $x^G$. The conjugacy class $x^G$ under conjugation, $a*b = a^b$, is a quandle. Here we call such a quandle a [*conjugation quandle*]{}. We note that such a quandle need not be connected. In general, a subquandle of a group $G$ under conjugation need not be a conjugacy class. But it is easy to see that if $X$ is a subset of a group $G$ closed under conjugation and if $X$ under conjugation is a connected quandle then $X$ is a conjugacy class of the group $\\langle X \\rangle$ generated by $X.$ Note that we are only interested in this paper in the case where both $X$ and $G$ are finite.\n\nWe show in this section that a connected quandle $E$ satisfies the condition in Theorem \\[thm:main\\] if and only if $E$ is a conjugation quandle.\n\nTo simplify the proof of the next theorem we will need the following lemma.\n\n\\[lem:triangle\\] Suppose $A$, $B$, and $C$ are quandles, $f$ and $g$ are quandle epimorphisms and $h$ is a well-defined bijection such that $g = hf$, then $h$ is a quandle isomorphism.\n\nLet $a_1, a_2 \\in A$. Since $f$ is an epimorphism there exist $c_1,c_2 \\in B$ such that $f(c_1) = a_1$ and $f(c_2) = a_2$. Then using $g = hf$ we have $h(a_1*a_2) = h(f(c_1)*f(c_2)) =\nh(f(c_1*c_2)) = g(c_1*c_2) = g(c_1)*g(c_2) = hf(c_1)*hf(c_2) = h(a_1)*h(a_2)$.\n\n\\[thm:conjugation\\_criterion\\] If $X$ is a conjugation quandle, then $X \\cong {\\rm inn}(Y)$ for some quandle $Y$.\n\nLet $X = x^G$ be a conjugation quandle for some finite group $G$ and element $x \\in G$. Define $f \\in {\\rm Aut}(G)$ by $f(a) = x^{-1}ax$, $a \\in G$ and let $Y$ be the generalized Alexander quandle ${\\rm GAlex}(G,f)$. Define $p: Y \\rightarrow X$ by $p(g) = x^g$. An easy calculation shows that $p$ is a homomorphism. The homomorphism $p$ is clearly surjective as is the homomorphism ${\\rm inn} : Y \\rightarrow {\\rm inn}(Y)$. Now we claim that the mapping $\\varphi: {\\rm inn}(Y) \\rightarrow X$ given by $\\varphi(R_g) = x^g$ is a bijection and hence by Lemma \\[lem:triangle\\] it is a quandle isomorphism. The see this we note that $R_g = R_h$ holds if and only if $a*g = a*h$ for all $a \\in G$. That is, if and only if $x^{-1} a g^{-1} x g = x^{-1} a h^{-1} x h$ which by cancellation is equivalent to $x^g = x^h$. This completes the proof.\n\n[ We note that if $Y$ is connected then $X = {\\rm inn}(Y)$ is a conjugacy class in ${\\rm Inn}(Y)$. So for connected $X$ the converse of Theorem \\[thm:conjugation\\_criterion\\] holds. In fact, by using Lemma 25 in [@Eis3] if $X$ is a connected conjugation quandle one may even find a connected quandle $Y$ such that $X \\cong {\\rm inn}(Y)$.

For a (finite) quandle $X=(X,*)$, its [*enveloping group*]{} is the group $G_X$ with presentation $$G_X =\\langle x_i , i \\in X \\ |\\  x_{i*j} = x_j^{-1}x_i x_j, i, j \\in X \\rangle$$ and with the natural mapping $$\\partial : X \\rightarrow G_X,\\  i \\mapsto x_i.$$ This group has been defined and used several times previously, Joyce [@Joyce] denoted it by $ {\\rm Adconj}(X)$, Fenn and Rourke called it the [*associated group*]{} and denoted it by ${\\rm As}(X)$ [@FR], and Eisermann [@Eis4] called it the [*adjoint group*]{} and denoted it by ${\\rm Adj}(X)$. The group $\\overline{G_X}$ obtained from $G_X$ by adding the relations ${x_i^{n_i}, i \\in  X}$ where $n_i$ is the order of $R_i$ is called the [*finite enveloping group*]{}. That this group is finite was proved in [@GHV], Lemma 2.17. As in [@HV] we write $$\\pi : G_X \\rightarrow \\overline{G_X}$$ for the canonical surjection. Let $$\\rho : X \\rightarrow  \\overline{G_X}$$ be the natural mapping from $X$ to $\\overline{G_X}$, that is $\\rho = \\pi \\partial$. It is clear that $\\rho$ is a quandle homomorphism to $\\overline{G_X}$ considered as a quandle under conjugation. Then we have the following theorem.\n\n\\[thm:VC\\] (Vendramin’s Criterion [@Leandro2]) A connected quandle $X$ is a conjugation quandle if and only if $\\rho : X \\rightarrow  \\overline{G_X}$ is an injection.\n\nIt is clear that the mapping $\\partial : X \\rightarrow G_X, i \\mapsto x_i$ is universal for quandle homomorphisms $f:X\\rightarrow G$ where G is considered as a conjugation quandle. That is, for any such $f$ there is a unique group homomorphism $g: G_X \\rightarrow G$ such that $f = g\\partial$. It then follows that if $f:X\\rightarrow G$ is an injection, that is, if $X$ is a conjugation quandle then $\\partial$ must also be an injection. By Lemma 1.8 in [@HV] $\\partial$ is injective implies that $\\rho$ is injective. Since $X$ is connected the converse is clear.\n\nClearly each faithful connected quandle is a conjugation quandle. Among the 790 connected quandles of order at most 47 there are precisely 66 non-faithful quandles. Using /Rig and Vendramin’s Criterion we find that exactly 30 of the 66 non-faithful Rig quandes are conjugations quandles. These are found in Table \\[table:conj\\].\n\n$$\\begin{array}{llllllll}\nQ(12,1) & Q(20,3) & Q(24,3) & Q(24,4) & Q(24,5) & Q(24,6) \\\\\nQ(24,14) & Q(24,16) & Q(24,17) & Q(30,1) & Q(30,16) & Q(32,5) \\\\ \nQ(32,6) & Q(32,7) & Q(32,8) & Q(36,1) & Q(36,4) & Q(36,17) \\\\ \nQ(36,20) & Q(36,21) & Q(36,28) & Q(36,30) & Q(40,12) & Q(40,13) \\\\ \nQ(40,17) & Q(40,18) & Q(40,19) & Q(40,20) & Q(42,12) & Q(42,21) \\\\ \n\n\\end{array}$$\n\nThese are listed in [@Edwin1] together with groups in which they are conjugation quandles. Furthermore each of these 30 quandles is an abelian extension of index 2 of the form ${\\rm inn}: Q \\rightarrow {\\rm inn}(Q)$, as indicated in Table \\[table:innconj\\]. By Theorem \\[ext\\_constant\\] the corresponding cocycle invariants of these extensions are constant for all knots. Note for example that $Q(12,8)$ has three different such cocycle extensions.

We were able to identify these using Theorem \\[thm:VC\\].\n\nIs there a connected quandle $Q$ with a 2-cocycle $\\phi: Q\\times Q \\rightarrow A$ with $|A| > 2$ such that $E(Q,\\phi,A)$ is a conjugation quandle?\n\nRelations among some types of epimorphisms {#sec:rel}\n==========================================\n\nIn this section, we examine relations among the epimorphisms used in the proofs of the main results; coverings, abelian extensions and inner representations. As we pointed out, abelian extensions and inner representations are coverings. We show that there is no other implication:\n\n[(i)]{} There exists an abelian extension that is not an inner representation.\n\n[(ii)]{} There exists an inner representation that is not an abelian extension.\n\n[(iii)]{} There exists a covering that is neither an abelian extension nor an inner representation.\n\n\\(i) Suppose $X$ is faithful, and let $E=E(X, A)$ be an abelian extension. Then $R_{(x,a)}=R_{(y,b)}$ if and only if $x=y$, where $(x,a), (y,b) \\in E=X \\times A$. Hence ${\\rm inn}: E \\rightarrow {\\rm inn}(E)$ is an abelian extension, where ${\\rm inn}(E)$ is isomorphic to $X$. If there is a proper non-trivial subgroup $C$ in $A$, then in [@CSV] it was proved that there is a sequence of abelian extensions $E(X, A) \\rightarrow E(X, A/C) \\rightarrow X $. If $X$ is faithful, therefore, $E(X, A) \\rightarrow E(X, A/C)$ is not the inner representation. An example is given by $\\pi: Q(24,2) \\rightarrow Q(12,2)$ where $Q(24,2) = E(Q(6,2),{{\\mathbb Z}}_4)$ and $Q(24,2) = E(Q(12,2),{{\\mathbb Z}}_2)$ as noted in [@CSV].\n\n\\(ii) This was given in [@CSV]: there it is shown that ${\\rm inn}: Q(30, 4) \\rightarrow Q(10,1)$ is not an abelian extension since $H_2^Q(Q(10,1))\\cong {{\\mathbb Z}}_2$. Another proof that this is not an abelian extension follows from Lemma \\[lem:criterion\\] below.\n\n\\(iii) Consider the product of the two mappings mentioned above: $${\\rm inn} \\times \\pi: Q(30,4) \\times Q(24,2) \\rightarrow Q(10,1) \\times Q(12,2),$$ where ${\\rm inn} \\times \\pi:  (x,y) \\mapsto ({\\rm inn}(x), \\pi(y))$. We know that ${\\rm inn}: Q(30,4) \\rightarrow Q(10,1)$ is an inner representation that is not an abelian extension and $\\pi: Q(24,2) \\rightarrow Q(12,2)$ is an abelian extension that is not an inner representation. We claim that ${\\rm inn} \\times \\pi$ is a covering but not an abelian extension and not an inner representation.\n\nTo see that ${\\rm inn} \\times \\pi$ is not an inner representation note that if ${\\rm inn}_Z$ denotes the inner representation on a quandle $Z$, then $${\\rm inn}_{X \\times Y} = {\\rm inn}_X \\times {\\rm inn}_Y.$$ Thus since $\\pi$ is not an inner representation neither is ${\\rm inn} \\times \\pi$.\n\nSince both ${\\rm inn}$ and $\\pi$ are coverings it is easy to see that their product is a covering. It is more difficult to show that ${\\rm inn} \\times \\pi$ is not an abelian extension. For this we use the following lemma.\n\n\\[lem:criterion\\] Let $X$ and $Y$ be finite quandles. Assume $f : Y \\rightarrow X$ is an abelian extension, $x \\in X$, $y \\in f^{-1}(x)$ and $\\beta \\in {\\rm Inn}(Y)$. If $\\beta(y) = y$ then $\\beta$ acts as the identity on the fiber $f^{-1}(x)$.\n\nWe take $Y = E(X,A,\\phi) = X \\times A$, and let $\\pi$ be the projection onto $X$. To simplify notation we write the quandle products in $X$ and $Y$ by juxtaposition. Moreover, we define $y_1y_2y_3 = (y_1y_2)y_3$ and inductively, for $n > 3$ we set $y_1y_2 \\cdots y_{n+1} =( y_1y_2 \\cdots y_{n})y_{n+1}$.\n\nSince $Y$ is finite for $\\beta \\in {\\rm  Inn}(Y)$ we may write $$\\beta  = R_{(x_n,a_n)} R_{(x_{n-1},a_{n-2})} \\cdots  R_{(x_1,a_1)}.$$ Then we have for $(z,b) \\in X \\times A$ $$\\beta(z,b) = (z,b)(x_1,a_1)(x_2,a_2) \\cdots (x_n,a_n) .$$ Using the definition of the product in $E(X,A,\\phi)$ it follows that $$\\beta(z,b) = (zx_1x_2 \\cdots x_n, b \\, \\phi(z,x_1) \\, \\phi(zx_1,x_2) \\, \\cdots \\, \\phi(zx_1x_2\\cdots x_{n-1},x_n)).$$ If we assume that $\\beta(z,b) = (z,b)$ then we have $$zx_1x_2 \\cdots x_n = z$$ and $$\\phi(z,x_1) \\, \\phi(zx_1,x_2) \\, \\cdots \\, \\phi(zx_1x_2\\cdots x_{n-1},x_n) = 1.$$ The fiber $\\pi^{-1}(z) $ is equal to $ \\{(z,c): c \\in A \\}.$ It follows that $\\beta(z,c) = (z,c)$ for all $c \\in A$, that is, $\\beta$ is the identity on the fiber $\\pi^{-1}(z)$, as claimed.\n\nNow returning to the claim that $${\\rm inn} \\times \\pi: Q(30,4) \\times Q(24,2) \\rightarrow Q(10,1) \\times Q(12,2)$$ is not an abelian extension, we note first that computation shows that for ${\\rm inn}: Q(30,4) \\rightarrow Q(10,1)$ there exist $z \\in Q(10,1)$, $\\alpha \\in {\\rm Inn}(Q(30,4))$ and $x,y \\in {\\rm inn}^{-1}(z)$ such that $\\alpha(x) = x$ but $\\alpha(y) \\neq y$. This gives an alternative proof via Lemma \\[lem:criterion\\] that ${\\rm inn}: Q(30,4) \\rightarrow Q(10,1)$ is not an abelian extension. Now to show that $ {\\rm inn} \\times \\pi: Q(30,4) \\times Q(24,2) \\rightarrow Q(10,1) \\times Q(12,2)$ is not an abelian extension, we note that using the same $x$ and $y$ we have that $(x,w)$ and $(y,w)$ for any $w \\in Q(24,2)$ lie in the same fiber of ${\\rm inn} \\times \\pi$. It is easy to see that ${\\rm Inn}(X \\times Y) ={\\rm  Inn}(X) \\times {\\rm Inn}(Y)$ for any quandles $X$ and $Y$. Thus taking $\\alpha \\in {\\rm Inn} (Q(30,4))$ and the identity ${\\rm id} \\in {\\rm Inn}(Q(24,2))$ we have that $\\beta = \\alpha \\times {\\rm id} \\in {\\rm  Inn} (Q(30,4) \\times Q(24,2)).$ Clearly $\\beta(x,w) = (x,w)$ and $\\beta(y,w) \\neq (y,w)$. So by Lemma \\[lem:criterion\\] we have that $ {\\rm inn} \\times \\pi$ is not an abelian extension.\n\nAcknowledgements {#acknowledgements .unnumbered}\n----------------\n\nMS was partially supported by NIH R01GM109459.

        "text": "“The Greenest Building in the World”\n\nFrom the Medfield Energy Committee’s David Temple (originally in the New York Times on 4/2/13) –\n\nSEATTLE — When an office building here that bills itself as the world’s greenest officially opens later this month, it will present itself as a “living building zoo,” with docents leading tours and smartphone-wielding tourists able to scan bar codes to learn about the artfully exposed mechanical and electrical systems.\n\nMultimedia\n\nTenants have already begun moving into the six-story Bullitt Center, in advance of its grand opening on Earth Day, April 22. With the final touches nearly complete on the 50,000-square-foot office building at 1501 East Madison Street, at the edge of the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, its occupants are about to embark upon an unparalleled — and very public — experiment in sustainability.\n\nOnce settled in, they will be guinea pigs in a $30 million living laboratory distinguished by its composting toilets, strict energy and water budgets and a conspicuous lack of on-site parking. To earn its environmental bragging rights, the Bullitt Center must complete a rigorous one-year certification process called the Living Building Challenge, which requires both water and energy self-sufficiency, among a list of 20 demands.\n\nProvided that the building clears a few remaining regulatory hurdles, all its water will be supplied by rainwater collected in a 56,000-gallon cistern before being filtered and disinfected. A rooftop array of photovoltaic panels, extending beyond the building like the brim of a graduation mortarboard, will produce an estimated 230,000 kilowatt-hours a year, hopefully just enough to break even for a building that is 83 percent more efficient than the city’s typical commercial site.\n\nThe project’s backers, led by the environmentally minded Bullitt Foundation, hope to demonstrate that a carbon-neutral office space can be commercially viable and aesthetically stunning without saddling its occupants with onerous demands. And they are determined to make their strategy and performance so transparent that it can be easily copied.\n\nInstead of tucking the mechanical and electrical rooms out of sight, for example, large plate glass windows will showcase the engineering, while quick response codes tag points of interest so tourists can use their smartphones to learn about individual elements, according to Chris Rogers, the chief executive and partner of the developer, Point32.\n\nA kiosk in a double-height exhibition space will also let visitors access real-time measurements like the building’s indoor air quality, energy consumption, photovoltaic power production and water levels. The Bullitt Center, in fact, will be one of the planet’s most closely monitored commercial buildings, allowing managers to single out energy hogs down to the level of individual plugs, said Robert B. Peña, an associate professor of architecture in the Integrated Design Lab at the University of Washington.\n\nIf the building is still the highest-performing one of its kind 10 years from now, said Denis Hayes, president and chief executive of the Bullitt Foundation, the experiment will have failed.\n\nThe Living Building Challenge’s imperatives go far beyond those of the better-known LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification. Its yearlong vetting process is designed in part to avoid the embarrassment suffered by some LEED certified buildings, where seemingly efficient buildings have proven to be much less so after the buildings have been completed and undergone energy audits.\n\nWhile a number of states, counties and municipalities provide tax credits and fee reductions for LEED structures, only a few municipalities have followed suit so far for the newer Living Building Challenge. Nevertheless, proponents say that avoiding energy and water utility bills for 250 years, the expected life span of the Bullitt Center, offers its own compelling financial incentives.\n\nThe Living Building Challenge has 143 registered projects in 10 countries. Its process is so demanding, however, that only three buildings in the United States have been fully certified so far; the largest of those is an eighth the size of the Bullitt Center.\n\nSo much potential energy savings has already been wrung out of the building in its construction that nearly half of the expected electricity use will depend on what’s plugged into the outlets. Every tenant will be expected to abide by strict annual usage budgets or pay for overages, but extra-fine electrical circuits and detailed outlet metering can help diagnose problem spots down to, say, a malfunctioning printer.\n\n(Page 2 of 2)\n\nMr. Hayes is keenly aware that the building’s success depends upon its attractiveness to tenants, and his development team is promoting several distinctive features, including the fact that it may be the first heavy-timber midrise building erected in Seattle since the 1920s. The timber and steel frame uses native Douglas fir certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. The exposed wood ceilings on the 13-foot-high upper floors also contribute to an airy loftlike feel, with exposed steel cross braces and 10-foot-high windows that maximize daylight.\n\nMultimedia\n\nAnother signature feature, a glass-enclosed stairwell that Mr. Hayes has named the “irresistible stairway,” rewards climbers with panoramic views of downtown and Puget Sound. The behavioral carrot, aimed at promoting both health and energy conservation, has been juxtaposed with the stick of a slow and less conveniently sited elevator that requires key card access. With advertised lease rates of $28 to $30 a square foot, the building is in line with comparable properties.\n\nIt helps that a group of enthusiastic early adopters has already leased more than two-thirds of the available office space. That group includes several organizations and companies heavily invested in the project’s success: PAE Consulting Engineers, the building’s lead engineering firm; the developer Point32, which will manage a 40-desk co-working space; the Integrated Design Lab, which played a major consulting role and will have both office space and a 40-seat classroom; and the International Living Future Institute, which since 2006 has run the Living Building Challenge.\n\nThe pioneering spirit resonates strongly with other tenants-to-be like Michele Gomes, co-owner and chief creative officer of Interchange Media Art Productions, a video and television production company.\n\nMs. Gomes and her business partner are leasing two desks on the fourth floor co-working space, a “huge move up” from her company’s current office in a windowless and perpetually cold basement, she said. Even more important, Ms. Gomes is eager to work among peers who have similar sustainability values. “To have like-minded people sharing the same space, to me that’s going to be extremely inspiring,” she said.\n\nIntentional Futures, a technology and software-focused design and engineering studio founded by former Microsoft executives, has leased the 7,900-square-foot fifth floor. Ian Sands, a co-founder and managing partner, said the 20-employee company had outgrown its office directly beneath a local broadcaster’s helipad and was looking to tap into the creative energy emanating from the city’s bustling Pike-Pine Corridor.\n\nAlthough Mr. Sands admires the decision to forgo a traditional garage, he said the lack of on-site parking, coupled with Seattle’s inadequate mass transit, could create commuting headaches for employees who live in the city’s eastern suburbs and who may “have to figure out other methods or places to park nearby because they will have to drive.”\n\nMr. Hayes said the decision to not have on-site parking generated “spirited conversation” during the design phase. Instead, a space about the size of a three-car garage will be reserved exclusively for bicycles, while commuting bicyclists can wash away the morning sweat in one of the rainwater-fed showers on each floor.\n\nSteve Whitney, the Bullitt Foundation’s program officer, said he had adapted to his new work space by buying a second bike.\n\nOn a partly cloudy afternoon in early March, Mr. Whitney, Mr. Hayes, and three other Bullitt Foundation employees gathered in a glass-walled conference room in their sixth floor office to offer some admittedly biased first impressions.\n\nLess than a week after moving from a nearly windowless brick carriage house, the employees were still amazed by the spectacular views, ample natural light and almost distracting quiet. The composting toilets, though, remained a source of curiosity even for them, and early discussions have centered on the pulse of foam that cascades down the inner rim of each funnel-shaped bowl to expedite its delivery to the waiting composters below.\n\nTwo weeks later, Mr. Peña led a tour group of corporate real estate professionals through the bowels of the Bullitt Center to check out the business end of the 24 toilets. Two rows of five bright blue aerobic composters, each the “size of a Fiat 500,” he figured, were busily doing their thing — so efficiently that the first compost extraction would not be required for another 18 months, when the resulting mulch will be commingled with other compost from King County.\n\nBut do they smell? Mr. Peña invited his tour group of 20 to inspect the boxy composters up close and determine for themselves: they did not. The aerobic process is odorless, provided that the building’s maintenance workers ensure proper ventilation and regular mixing.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Peña hoped the building’s novelties would become invisible as the occupants adjusted. “As much as I like to think of this building as a living laboratory, I think for the commercial tenants in this building, we also want it to be just as normal as possible,” he said.\n\nOsler ”Pete” Peterson\n\nMedfield Selectman\n\nI started this blog to share the interesting and useful information that I saw while doing my job as a Medfield selectman.

So far as the writers know, idiopathic chondrolysis has not previously been reported in the literature in a male of the white race after the end of skeletal growth. In this case biopsy disclosed necrosis and fibrosis of the articular cartilage with extensive infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the synovial membrane and in the subchondral medullary spaces. In all the cases described there was gradual regression of pain and improvement in the radiographic appearances within about one year. Moderate limitation of movement persisted, however, especially internal and external rotation. In all cases the treatment consisted of protected weight bearing and physiotherapy."

Standardized death rates often show the certain level of medical standards in the different countries. The aim of this paper was to determine suicide rates in Croatia and its neighbouring countries (Hungary, Slovenia and Italy) associated with induced abortions and standardized death rates Method: It was a register linkage study. Information on suicides of women in Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy were linked with induced abortions and standardized death rates in these countries. Nationwide data in Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy in the period 1996-2002 i.e. the latest available data for each county was used. There were suicide rates in women: Croatia (2000)-10.3, Hungary (1999)-15.4, Slovenia (1999)-13.4 and Italy (1998)-3.6. There were induced abortions (% of live born children): Croatia (2002)-17.8, Hungary (2002)-69.7, Slovenia (2002)-49.6 and Italy (2002)-24.0. There were standardized death rates (1/10.000 population): Croatia (1998)-113.8, Hungary (1996)-109.3, Slovenia (1996)-109.3 and Italy (1996)-70.7. The Croatian suicide rate and induced abortions have been lower than in Hungary and Slovenia. Croatia has been at the last place according to induced abortions but Croatia has been at the first place due to standardized death rates."

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Congress leader P Chidambaram was on Thursday sent to CBI custody till August 26 by a Delhi court which said his custodial interrogation was justified in the INX Media corruption case.\"Allegations against Chidambaram are serious in nature and in-depth investigation is required,\" the court said as it rejected the arguments of the Congress leader's lawyers.\"Considering the facts and circumstances, I am of the view that police custody is justified,\" special judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar said after listening to the arguments of both sides.\"Trail of money, if so paid, is to be ascertained. It is a case based on documentary evidence and those documents need to be traced,\" the court said.The court observed that allegations of payment to Chidambaram in 2007-08 and 2008-09 are specific and categorical.\"Investigation needs to be brought to a logical end for which custodial interrogation is sometimes found useful and fruitful,\" it said.Ruling in favour of CBI, the court ordered that during Chidambaram's custody the agency will get him medically examined regularly as per the rules, and allowed his family members and lawyers to meet him for half an hour every day.Chidambaram was produced in the court amidst tight security and senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for him, argued that the first arrest in the case was of Bhaskar Raman, chartered accountant of Karti, who is presently out on bail.The court heard the arguments of the CBI and Chidambaram's counsel for over one-and-half hours during which the agency said there was a need to unearth a larger conspiracy and to go to the root of the case.Chidamabaram's counsel opposed the CBI plea saying that all the other accused, including his son Karti, have already been granted bail in the case.Besides that, Peter and Indrani Mukherjea, also accused in the case, are out on default bail as they are in jail in connection with another matter, Sibal said.He said the FIPB approval was given by senior officials, who were not arrested.He also contended that grant of bail was a rule and the issue before the court was of personal liberty.However, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said CBI has to interrogate Chidambaram in custody as he was non-cooperative and evasive in replies.The solicitor general told the court that the agency was not extorting confession from Chidambaram but it had the right to reach the root of the case.\"It is a serious case involving intelligent people and we will fail in our duty if we don't get to the root of the case,\" the solicitor general said, adding that even Karti underwent custodial interrogation in the case.Mehta said Chidambaram has tremendous potential of not cooperating in probe since he is highly intelligent and certain facts about the case cannot be narrated in the open court.Besides Sibal, senior advocate Abhishek M Singhvi also appeared for Chidambaram, and opposed CBI's plea saying that the former Union minister was not a flight risk.Singhvi said the entire CBI case was based on the statement of Indrani Mukherjea, who has turned approver in the case.He said Chidambaram cannot answer what CBI wants to hear and added that the agency cannot seek remand on the ground of evasive replies.He also argued that there was no allegation of tampering of evidence by CBI.Singhvi further contended that police remand can only be granted in special circumstances and this was a case where there was no new development.He said the agency was asking Chidambaram only old questions since his arrest on Wednesday night.Mehta countered the arguments advanced on behalf of Chidambaram, saying that everybody was equal before the court.He also opposed the plea that Chidambaram be allowed to argue for himself, saying he has able lawyers representing him.Mehta said during his initial arguments that Chidambaram entered into a criminal conspiracy with others in the scam.Chidambaram was arrested after issuance of non-bailable warrant against him, he said, adding that it is a serious and monumental case of money laundering.\"He is not cooperating in the investigation,\" Mehta said, adding that he has been evasive in replies and grave offence was committed.He also said Chidambaram's custodial interrogation was necessary to unearth the \"quid pro quo and larger conspiracy\" and he is required to be confronted with documents.Mehta contended that serious, active and informed role of the accused is made out and money trail is made out and has to be probed.Opposing CBI's arguments, Sibal contended that what the agency said be not taken as \"gospel truth\".He said that Chidambaram was asked 12 questions and he had already answered six of them previously.Sibal said Chidambaram had requested the agency sleuths to take him in custody on Thursday morning as he had not slept for last 24 hours.But they did not listen to him and took him last night itself, he said.Sibal further argued that CBI could have written a letter to Chidambaram for producing the documents alleged to be in his possession and the agency cannot say he was evasive during the investigation.After the pronouncement of the order, 73-year-old Chidambaram was immediately taken out of the court room by the CBI team.Chidambaram, who was Union home minister and also finance minister during the UPA rule from 2004 to 2014, was arrested Wednesday night after he failed to get protection from the Supreme Court, which did not list for an urgent hearing his appeal against the Delhi high court verdict dismissing his anticipatory bail plea on Tuesday.The CBI had registered an FIR on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram's tenure as the finance minister.Thereafter, the ED lodged a money laundering case in this regard in 2018."

        "text": "Effects of interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor on sensitivity of dorsal root ganglion and peripheral receptive fields in rats.\nThis study was designed to characterize the effects of low doses (0.5-5 ng) of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), on the neural activity of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in rats. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF) on the somatosensory neural response of DRG. The release of inflammatory cytokines by an injured disc may play a critical role in pain production at nerve endings, axons, and nerve cell bodies. Herniated disc tissue has been shown to release IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF, and other algesic chemicals. Their effects on nerve endings in disc and adjacent tissue may lead to low back pain and their effects on dorsal root axons and ganglia may lead to sciatica. Exposed lumbar DRGs were investigated by electrophysiologic techniques. Sham (mineral oil), control (carrier solution), or IL-1beta, IL-6, or TNF at doses of 0.5, 1, and 5 ng were applied over the DRG. Baseline discharge rates as well as mechanosensitivity of the DRG and peripheral receptive fields were evaluated over 30 min. Applications of IL-1beta at 1 ng resulted in an increase in the discharge rate, 5 ng resulted in an increased mechanosensitivity of the DRG in group II units. Similarly, after 1 ng TNF applications, group II units also showed an increase in mechanosensitivity of DRG and peripheral receptive fields. At low doses IL-1beta and TNF sensitization of receptive fields were observed. The responses observed in the group II units indicate that a sub-population of afferent units might have long-term effects modifying the sensory input to the central nervous system. This study provides added evidence to the role of cytokines in modulating afferent activity following inflammation."

        "text": "1. Introduction {#sec1-ijerph-14-01007}\n===============\n\nThe sustainable development goals have put universal health coverage in the midst of the world health agenda and with it health system strengthening \\[[@B1-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. This shift in the international policy agenda warrants a move to more health systems oriented research and evaluation. Simultaneously, the latter two domains increasingly focus on \"complexity\" in health systems \\[[@B2-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. This has resulted in many different methodological responses: the defiance \\[[@B3-ijerph-14-01007],[@B4-ijerph-14-01007]\\] and/or adaptation \\[[@B5-ijerph-14-01007]\\] of existing randomized controlled trial methodologies; the application of theory of change \\[[@B6-ijerph-14-01007]\\]; the rising prominence of realist evaluation \\[[@B7-ijerph-14-01007],[@B8-ijerph-14-01007]\\] and, more generally, the use of theory-driven evaluations \\[[@B9-ijerph-14-01007],[@B10-ijerph-14-01007]\\]; and the introduction of systems thinking \\[[@B11-ijerph-14-01007],[@B12-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Here, we combine theory-driven evaluation, and systems thinking to tackle this complexity and open the 'black box' of an intervention, i.e., discover the mechanisms that lead to the outcomes.\n\nTheory-driven evaluation emphasizes the importance of an extensive and explicit theory as a hypothesis for evaluation/research \\[[@B9-ijerph-14-01007],[@B10-ijerph-14-01007]\\], aiming to uncover the mechanisms leading to certain outcomes and to test the intervention's program theory. The latter is \"a set of explicit or implicit assumptions by stakeholders about what action is required to solve a social, educational, or health problem and why the problem will respond to this action\" \\[[@B13-ijerph-14-01007]\\] (p. 17). We add that insights from earlier research can further strengthen the program theory. After the creation of the program theory, the evaluation then sets out to study whether this program theory actually materialized in order to understand observed outcomes. The development of the program theory necessitates an in-depth understanding of a context characterized by complexity. However, this complexity is ignored by many program theories; instead reverting to a linear graphical visualization highly resembling the well-known \"logical framework\" (e.g., \\[[@B14-ijerph-14-01007],[@B15-ijerph-14-01007]\\]) thus reproducing its shortcomings in situations of complexity \\[[@B16-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\nLike Dr. Patricia Rogers and Bob Williams \\[[@B17-ijerph-14-01007]\\], we believe that a \"systems thinking approach\" can be a useful way to deal with this issue of complexity. More specifically, as a program theory mainly aims to uncover inter-relations between the elements of the project and the pre-existing environment, tools from the sub-field of system dynamics are especially useful \\[[@B18-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Systems thinking takes a holistic approach towards interventions \\[[@B11-ijerph-14-01007],[@B12-ijerph-14-01007]\\] as it looks at interaction effects, feedback loops, and emergence (Emergence means that the interactions between the different parts of the system lead to effects or properties at the system level that are different from those observed at the level of the constituting parts.) within the larger system, such as a health care system, instead of focusing on linear relationships between two variables. Moreover, in our approach we stress the fact that an intervention is implemented in a pre-existing system/environment/context; the intervention influences the context, not the other way around. Causal loop diagramming (CLD) is one of the tools from the systems dynamic sub-field used to analyze systems and stems from industrial management research in the 1960s \\[[@B19-ijerph-14-01007]\\] and organizational learning \\[[@B20-ijerph-14-01007]\\], but it also has some useful applications in the health sector \\[[@B21-ijerph-14-01007],[@B22-ijerph-14-01007],[@B23-ijerph-14-01007],[@B24-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. CLD is a qualitative visual aid used to communicate the assumptions of a \"mental model of a dynamic system\" \\[[@B25-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. The latter is a \"relatively enduring and accessible, but limited, internal conceptual representation of an external system whose structure maintains the perceived structure of that system\" \\[[@B26-ijerph-14-01007]\\] (p. 17), i.e., a theory of the system/intervention at hand or a program theory. By visualizing these assumptions, the approach aims to better understand the behavior of the system and its agents. As the name implies, a specific focus of this tool is on discovering feedback loops in the system. Similar to the program theory within theory-driven evaluation, it relies on the inputs of relevant stakeholders, beneficiaries, key informants and the researcher's knowledge of earlier studies. Therefore, it is very well suited to guide the definition of a program theory at the beginning of a theory-driven evaluation.\n\nBy using CLD, a well thought-out program theory can be devised. In turn, hypotheses can be generated which feed into a theory-driven evaluation, leading to a more in-depth evaluation and knowledge of the mechanisms at play.\n\nTo showcase this, we analyze the implementation of a performance-based financing (PBF) intervention of the Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC) in the Rwenzori and West Nile regions of Western Uganda. PBF has increased in popularity as way of improving the performance of the health care system in low- and middle-income countries. In its broadest sense, PBF is a results-oriented reform package composed of financial incentives (for facilities and/or health workers based on quality measures, and the number of targeted services), and some or all of the following elements: a separation of functions, (spending) autonomy for the health facilities, strict monitoring and verification of services, community involvement, results-oriented planning, and accountability arrangements (see \\[[@B27-ijerph-14-01007]\\] for a discussion on the broad and narrow definitions of PBF).\n\nAlthough PBF has achieved some remarkable results, especially in Rwanda \\[[@B28-ijerph-14-01007]\\], the overall outcomes and effects of this intervention are mixed \\[[@B29-ijerph-14-01007],[@B30-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Gaining insights into the mechanisms that lead to success and failure will help practitioners improve the design of PBF schemes and other health interventions. The use of a systems thinking approach was proposed several years ago, but with little follow-up \\[[@B31-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. This paper contributes to filling this gap. Moreover, as observed by Marchal et al. \\[[@B32-ijerph-14-01007]\\], multi-component interventions (like PBF) may elicit difficulties of attribution when using theory-driven evaluations, more specifically realist evaluation. We believe that the use of CLD may help to overcome this as it is specifically designed to address the issue of multi-causality. Being a reform package with several components, PBF is thus the ideal test case.\n\nThis study is part of broader research evaluating the implementation of BTC's PBF intervention. The study received ethical approval from the institutional review boards of Makerere University School of Public Health (protocol 334, 11 September 2015), the Institute of Tropical Medicine of Antwerp, and the University Hospitals of Antwerp (B300201525175, 13 July 2015).\n\n2. Materials and Methods {#sec2-ijerph-14-01007}\n========================\n\n2.1. Study Setting {#sec2dot1-ijerph-14-01007}\n------------------\n\nThe study was set in Uganda, one of the latest sub-Saharan African countries planning to roll out a nationwide PBF scheme. Uganda is also one of the sub-Saharan African countries that failed to achieve the health-related Millennium Development Goals \\[[@B33-ijerph-14-01007]\\] and has a health care system that suffers from understaffing, low wages, poor supervision, regular drug depletion at facilities, and poor logistics management \\[[@B34-ijerph-14-01007],[@B35-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. With a maternal mortality ratio of 343 per 100,000 live births, a healthy life expectancy at birth of 54 years, and an under-five mortality rate of 54.6 per 1000 live births, Uganda ranks 146th, 156th, and 155th out of 194 countries, respectively \\[[@B36-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\nThe health sector is comprised of three types of facilities providing modern health care: public, private not-for-profit (PNFP), and private for-profit. This study focuses on the PNFP sector, which comprises 40--50% of the health care facilities in Uganda \\[[@B37-ijerph-14-01007],[@B38-ijerph-14-01007]\\] and consists mainly of the health facilities from the Ugandan Catholic Medical Bureau (UCMB), Ugandan Protestant Medical Bureau (UPMB), and Ugandan Muslim Medical Bureau (UMMB). Given the decentralized nature of the Ugandan health system, these medical boards have a certain level of autonomy, but the District Health Management Team remains an important oversight body. Each facility has a Health Unit Management Committee that guides and oversees the management of the facility and is composed of representatives from the community, local government, and health facility.\n\nDue to their institutional location, PNFP facilities receive fewer public funds than the government facilities. Health workers in the PNFP sector are generally paid from the patients' user fees, whereas health workers at government facilities receive a fixed salary from the government. Although some facilities in Kasese district have staffs that are on government payroll (see below). Since 2001, health care services are, in principle, free of charge at government facilities; by contrast user fees are still paid at PNFP facilities except for certain services, such as antenatal care and vaccinations, among others. Notwithstanding the lower budget and lower salaries in the PNFP sector, the latter is considered to be delivering higher quality services than the government facilities, mainly due to regular medicine stock outs in the latter \\[[@B37-ijerph-14-01007],[@B38-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Given their important role in delivering health care services to the general public (including the poor and rural areas), the Ugandan PNFP facilities are sometimes referred to as \"quasi-public organizations\" \\[[@B39-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\nUganda's far-fetched decentralization is noticeable in the organization of its health care sector; starting from the Village Health Teams, it goes up to Health Centers (HCs) II, III, and IV (the latter is either a hospital or an upgraded health center and the focal point of a sub-district) and the regional and national referral hospitals. This study focuses on HCs III and IV from the catholic and the protestant medical bureaus in two districts of the Rwenzori region in Western Uganda: Kasese and Kyenjojo ([Figure 1](#ijerph-14-01007-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). [Table 1](#ijerph-14-01007-t001){ref-type=\"table\"} lists the most relevant differences. Importantly, a significant part of the health workers in the Kasese district are government-seconded staff paid according to the higher government scales, whereas all Kyenjojo district health workers are paid from patients' user fees. In addition, the number of facilities that managed to qualify for the intervention (see below) differs significantly between the two districts.\n\n2.2. BTC's PBF Intervention {#sec2dot2-ijerph-14-01007}\n---------------------------\n\nThe BTC intervention is restricted to HCs III and IV and regional hospitals of the PNFP sub-sector. Health facilities go through a pre-qualification assessment of the level of infrastructural quality (e.g., presence of incinerator, waste bins, etc.), with three possible outcomes: qualification for the PBF intervention, conditional qualification (facility receives a minor investment according to a performance improvement plan aimed at achieving the criteria), and re-assessment 6 months after implementation of an investment plan (receives no intervention funds). Selected health facilities are eligible to sign a PBF contract, receive a one-time investment for drugs and small equipment, and receive quarterly extra funds based on their infrastructural quality and number of qualitative services provided (i.e., their performance). A more elaborate description of the intervention according to the \"descriptive framework\" (A framework that indicates which elements need to be described in order to enhance comprehension and appropriately contextualize the intervention.) proposed previously \\[[@B27-ijerph-14-01007]\\] can be found in [Supplementary Material 1](#app1-ijerph-14-01007){ref-type=\"app\"} and [Section 3.8](#sec3dot8-ijerph-14-01007){ref-type=\"sec\"}.\n\n2.3. Data Collection and Analysis {#sec2dot3-ijerph-14-01007}\n---------------------------------\n\nIdeally, program theory and CLD are based on a thorough needs assessment of the health care environment among local stakeholders \\[[@B41-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Here, we performed CLD (using Vensim© PLE version 6.4 software, Ventana Systems Inc., Harvard, MA, USA) on the basis of qualitative interviews with health workers in order to visualize their \"mental model\" of the health system (step 1). As we claimed in the introduction that an intervention is always introduced in a pre-existing environment, this causal loop diagram serves as the basis in which we will later introduce the PBF intervention. We then performed qualitative interviews among KIs (respondents from the Ministry of Health, BTC, Medical Bureaus, and districts), asking them about how the PBF intervention will affect the system identified in step 1 (step 2). We strengthened step 2 by including insights from studies on PBF described in a recent literature review \\[[@B30-ijerph-14-01007]\\] (step 3). Finally, we analyzed several feedback loops that may serve as hypotheses (step 4).\n\nThe data collection among health workers (step 1) was performed by the first author in September--October 2015, before the start of the PBF intervention and before facilities knew the outcome of the pre-qualification assessment. In each of the 15 facilities visited, the first author conducted one to three semi-structured interviews with health workers present at the facility. All interviewees were informed about the general study objectives and assured that disclosed information was treated confidentially without any influence on their job or BTC's evaluation of the facility. We emphasized that we were university researchers not affiliated with the BTC. The interviews were conducted in English, which is the language of instruction in medical schools.\n\nThe topics on which the respondents' opinions were asked relate to our definition of PBF and include their motivation, recordkeeping, supervision, community participation, and work environment. In order to obtain a clear view of what they considered major dysfunctions in their health care environment, we interrogated them on the causes of one specific health problem, maternal mortality. This enabled us to divert from the theoretical needs of the health care system and forced the health workers to think about the real barriers to adequate health care. We chose the example of maternal mortality because maternal services are often targeted by PBF schemes \\[[@B42-ijerph-14-01007],[@B43-ijerph-14-01007]\\], which also holds for this PBF intervention, and because it is a health issue known for requiring a system-wide approach. Afterwards, the interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded using the open-coding technique in QSR Nvivo© 10 software (QSR International Pty Ltd., Doncaster, Australia).\n\nA total of 30 semi-structured interviews were performed with predominantly female health workers from the different health facilities ([Table 2](#ijerph-14-01007-t002){ref-type=\"table\"}). Though there was a relatively good balance between the different cadres, half of the respondents were nurses or nursing officers. This proportion largely matches the characteristics of the reference population. We also have no reason to assume that the health workers from the night shift (not included in the sample) would differ significantly from those on the day shift, as a rotating system is in place.\n\nThe semi-structured interviews with the KIs (step 2) were conducted by the first author during March 2017. Questions concerned the details of the intervention and how the respondents expected the intervention to have an impact on the health care outcomes. Respondents were chosen purposefully in order to interview those most closely involved in designing and implementing the intervention. We performed 16 interviews with KIs, including high-level officials within the MoH, BTC, and medical bureaus, as well as key stakeholders from the district level ([Table 3](#ijerph-14-01007-t003){ref-type=\"table\"}).\n\n2.4. Causal Loop Analysis {#sec2dot4-ijerph-14-01007}\n-------------------------\n\nIn CLD, variables are presented and causally linked to each other using arrows. Each arrow has a direction and polarity: \"+\" means that a change in the first variable in a certain direction causes a change in the second variable in the same direction compared to the situation without the change in the first variable, whereas \"−\" means that the change occurs in the opposite direction. Some causal effects take time to manifest, and this delay is represented by a double line on the arrow (//). The causal loop diagrams in this paper are simplified to an extent (e.g., incentives and basic salary are combined in one variable \"salary\") to facilitate interpretation. Causal loop analysis entails examination of the diagram in order to find feedback loops that are either positive (reinforcing) or negative (balancing), as shown by a clockwise or counterclockwise arrow with an \"R\" or \"B\" in the middle, respectively.\n\n2.5. Limitations {#sec2dot5-ijerph-14-01007}\n----------------\n\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, even though we strongly emphasized that we were independent researchers, health workers may have had the impression that we were representing the BTC. This may have resulted in socially desirable answers. Second, we focused on the health workers' perceptions to identify the context and the perception of higher-ups to identify the effect of the PBF intervention, which may be different from the reality perceived by other stakeholders (e.g., the community), or even the actual reality (e.g., workload \\[[@B44-ijerph-14-01007]\\]). However, perceptions are often the drivers of behavior, making them important. Third, we had to trade-off between \"breadth\" and \"depth\". As we decided to discuss the entire set of PBF elements, we went for the first option. Fourth, we mainly focused on information found in studies on other PBF interventions, the analysis can and should be extended to include other programs with similar mechanisms as well. Finally, CLD is focused on feedback loops, but these are not the only points of interest and other types of relationships (e.g., linear, logarithmic, parabolic) deserve equal attention.\n\n3. Results {#sec3-ijerph-14-01007}\n==========\n\n3.1. CLD Set-Up {#sec3dot1-ijerph-14-01007}\n---------------\n\nThe main objective and outcome variable is improved health care outcomes. Therefore, it is in the center of the diagram ([Figure 2](#ijerph-14-01007-f002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). For the sake of this exercise, we assumed that the main contributors to better health care outcomes are health worker performance, which comprises (yet not represented in the diagram) the health workers' attitudes toward the patients, appropriateness of the care provided, and correct implementation of the treatment plan. The second and third contributors are the work environment, which entails the available equipment, infrastructure, and drugs, and patient behavior, which includes health care-seeking behavior and therapy loyalty.\n\nTaking another step back, the performance of health workers is influenced by their motivation and knowledge. The work environment is co-determined by the health facility budget and the capacity of management to plan and implement. Patient behavior is a result of patients' positive or negative perceptions of the facility, which are influenced by the health care outcomes and health worker performance, patient knowledge and beliefs, and the accessibility of the facility, including financial, geographic, culture, and social accessibility.\n\n3.2. Motivation {#sec3dot2-ijerph-14-01007}\n---------------\n\nOur interviews underscored that the health workers' motivation is influenced by many sources. Many of the health workers were intrinsically motivated by the tasks they perform; however, the recognition they receive from the community is also an important driver of motivation. A bad work environment was seen as an important de-motivator. Similarly, almost all of the health workers felt that they do not earn enough (salary). There was no difference between staff on government payroll and those paid from user fees, despite the difference in salary.\n\n> \"I wouldn't say we are extremely happy with what we are paid.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 2 Clinical Officer)\n\n> \"I feel good when I'm putting on my white... (LAUGHS) and the way I am serving patients and the way how the community is appreciating...\"\n>\n> (Resp. 21 Nurse)\n\nFinancial incentives based on performance were not well understood by the health workers, but among the 10 who understood the concept, 7 thought that they would help motivate health workers.\n\n> \"Those incentives are good. They are good, but we do not have them \\[...\\] They are good because they improve on one's motivation.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 14 Nurse)\n\nBenefits, other than salary, that make the government sector more attractive are higher job security, pension, and study leave opportunities.\n\n> \"Of course government sector is the best because of their payment. They can also give you a study leave.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 21 Nurse)\n\n3.3. Recordkeeping {#sec3dot3-ijerph-14-01007}\n------------------\n\nRespondents listed a diversity of reasons for the importance of recordkeeping. Some highlighted its utility for planning at the health facility level, others thought it improves patient care, that it is useful for surveillance, informational purposes, and accountability, and that it can also trigger motivation.\n\n> \"It helps us in planning. It helps us in making decisions---like we are able to know that we have such a number of patients \\[...\\] who will need such an amount of treatment or drugs.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 6 Nursing Officer)\n\n> \"We have to keep it to show that we are working.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 20 Nurse)\n\nThese different uses for recordkeeping can be categorized under the two generic functions of monitoring/recordkeeping systems: the feedback/learning function (using it for planning at the facility level and patient care) and the accountability function (reporting to higher authorities or the community) \\[[@B45-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. The feedback/learning function was mentioned by 24 of the 30 respondents, whereas 17 respondents highlighted the accountability function. However, only three of these respondents explicitly referred to the community as the target audience, though all of them referred to upward accountability.\n\nAlthough the majority of the respondents stated that the recordkeeping is easy and does not impact the workload much, probably due to the low patient flow at the visited facilities, 10 out of 11 respondents highlighted that computerization of the recordkeeping may simplify the work, especially if patient numbers increase.\n\n> \"\\[O\\]nly sometimes the challenging part of it is when you are overloaded with work \\[...\\] but in general the data, the way we are collecting it, doesn\\'t need much effort or time.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 11 Midwife)\n\n3.4. Supervision {#sec3dot4-ijerph-14-01007}\n----------------\n\nAlmost all of the respondents (24 out of 28) spontaneously highlighted the importance of qualitative supervision for health worker knowledge and performance. The majority of the respondents preferred formative and personal supervision over a cursory checklist evaluation of the data in the registers. One respondent argued that the latter may be caused by too high of a workload for the supervisors. Although respondents were satisfied with the supervision by the district health management team, they felt that it should be more frequent. Yet, they were aware that this requires sufficient resources.\n\n> \"Supervision helps us to improve on the quality of work.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 11 Midwife)\n\n> \"Others \\[...\\] They just come and give you a talk and they go \\[without\\] even checking what has gone wrong and correct you.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 19 Nursing Officer)\n\nOnly 10% of the interviewees spontaneously mentioned motivation as an important outcome of the supervision they currently receive. Such motivation comes mainly from close interactions with the supervisor and the feedback received, which emphasizes the importance of close and formative supervision.\n\n> \"It is so encouraging like when I am doing work and they come in to supervise me and tell me I\\'m doing a good work.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 10 Clinical Officer)\n\n3.5. Community Participation {#sec3dot5-ijerph-14-01007}\n----------------------------\n\nThe health workers who were interviewed highlighted three not mutually exclusive roles for the community within the health unit management committee: an informational role, which implies reporting of the concerns, needs, and wishes of the community to the management committee and health workers with the aim to improve the appropriateness and quality of the health services provided; a dissemination role, disseminating information and helping with sensitization within the community, but as mentioned above the information does not necessarily relate to the facility's performance; and a decision making role. In general, the first two roles are welcomed by the health workers, whereas the capacity of the community to take on a decision-making role is doubted (e.g., the construction of a new building). The majority of the respondents felt that the main decision-making power should lie with the health workers who, according to the health workers themselves, have sufficient technical capacity and knowledge, unlike the community.\n\n> \"No, they should have less \\[decision power\\] simply because they are not the technical persons.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 14 Nurse)\n\n3.6. Working Environment {#sec3dot6-ijerph-14-01007}\n------------------------\n\nWhile visiting the facilities, we found that very few patients (often \\<10 daily) attend them. Among the most likely explanations is the competition from government health facilities, which provide free health care. Moreover, given the rural context, patients have to travel greater distances to come to the facility and have fewer financial resources compared to more urban areas. This low number of patients is not only problematic for the health facility budget, and consequently the work environment, but also for the health workers' motivation to be effectively present at the health facility.\n\n> \"\\[T\\]oday I have seen only two people \\[...\\], so if there are supposed to be two health workers on duty, you cannot both come to see two people.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 5 Clinical Officer)\n\nHowever, in facilities with several mothers coming in for antenatal care and many HIV patients coming in for treatment, both of which are free services (50 patients for two afternoons per week), there are complaints about the heavy workload due to the low staffing level (see also Zakumumpa et al. \\[[@B46-ijerph-14-01007]\\]). This is especially evident in the maternity ward, where only one midwife is often responsible for all maternal health services. However, vacancy levels differ greatly between facilities, and even departments (e.g., maternity and out-patient departments) \\[[@B47-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Times of high workload have consequences on the health workers' performance and their motivation, and puts pressure on the work environment (equipment, space, drugs, etc.).\n\n> \"I will give an example of the maternity ward. You find someone is attending to a mother in labor, soon you find that the one at \\[the delivery\\] is the one who is supposed to attend to those who have already delivered. So the work that should be done by four people is being done by one person.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 2 Clinical Officer)\n\nHealth workers also highlighted inadequate infrastructure (13 respondents) and equipment (16 respondents), including the lack of sufficient qualitative staff quarters, patient wards, and appropriate equipment and drugs, which forces them to improvise or send the patients to private medical stores.\n\n> \"\\[I\\]f those sets are not there we improvise with the \\[...\\] razor blade.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 17 Nurse)\n\n3.7. Maternal Mortality {#sec3dot7-ijerph-14-01007}\n-----------------------\n\nDemand-side barriers are the most referenced causes of maternal mortality. More than half of the respondents mentioned poverty or the lack of financial resources, as this leads to bad health conditions (malnutrition, sickness), increasing the risk of complications during birth. Moreover, the cost of transportation, the facility user fee, and the consumables they have to buy, pushes poor women to deliver with a traditional birth attendant rather than at a facility, which is considered the safer option.\n\n> \"\\[T\\]he crises of money \\[...\\] they get anemia, malnutrition which can complicate labor, they can end up dying.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 13 Nurse)\n\nHalf of the health workers blame the ignorance of mothers. Traditional beliefs, a lack of knowledge, and stubbornness are considered reasons why mothers deliver in the villages with the help of traditional birth attendants instead of at a health facility, or come to the facility when it is already too late.\n\n> \"They have their traditional beliefs \\[...\\], they are those with a rigid mind even though you teach, they will become stubborn.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 19 Nursing Officer)\n\nIn addition to these demand-side barriers, the health workers also highlighted supply-side factors. An important issue highlighted by 16 respondents was the poor geographic accessibility of the health facilities. A problem compounded by the lack of ambulances at the facility level and the financial barriers to transport.\n\n> \"\\[P\\]eople come from mountainous areas and you find the transportation itself being bad, and ambulance services still low.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 11 Midwife)\n\nThe causes of maternal mortality pointed out thus far are based on the assumption that not delivering at the facility is detrimental to the outcome of the delivery. However, even when pregnant women manage to get to the health facilities, problems may still arise due to other obstacles, such as lack of equipment, infrastructure, and qualified health workers (highlighted by 14 respondents). Sub-standard quality services caused by poor health worker attitudes are very likely an important contributing factor that tends to be underestimated by most health workers (only six respondents mentioned it).\n\n> \"Also health workers, they are there who are quarrelsome to mothers. And you find that the mothers fear to express the way she is feeling.\"\n>\n> (Resp. 4 Midwife)\n\n[Figure 3](#ijerph-14-01007-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows the causal loop diagram obtained after assessing the needs of the health care environment as perceived by the health workers. As not all variables have an immediate effect, we included delay marks where needed. Importantly, the health facility budget only has a positive effect on the work environment and number of health workers from a certain level onward because an important part of the budget is reserved to cover recurrent costs.\n\n3.8. Introducing the PBF Intervention {#sec3dot8-ijerph-14-01007}\n-------------------------------------\n\nAs discussed elsewhere \\[[@B27-ijerph-14-01007],[@B48-ijerph-14-01007]\\], PBF is a reform package that intervenes at different points of the health care system. In this section, we integrate BTC's PBF intervention into our causal loop diagram ([Figure 4](#ijerph-14-01007-f004){ref-type=\"fig\"}) using input from both the KI interviews and existing knowledge from the literature (steps 2 and 3). The dotted lines and underlined text in [Figure 4](#ijerph-14-01007-f004){ref-type=\"fig\"} represent the direct influence of the PBF intervention. As already stated, a thorough description of the intervention can be found in [Supplementary file 1](#app1-ijerph-14-01007){ref-type=\"app\"}.\n\nCentral to every PBF intervention is that it creates a link between pre-defined measures and the budget/salary. In our specific case, the PBF bonus to the health facility budget is based on the quality of the work environment, the performance of the health worker, and the number of patients treated. Twenty-five percent of the PBF bonus can be used for health worker incentives (salary) based on individual performance.\n\nAnother important aspect of this PBF intervention is that the funds are seen as a subsidization of the user fees, which are subsequently reduced. This leads to increased financial accessibility and more patients coming to the facility (KIs 1, 4, 7--9, 11--15). As discussed in the description of the intervention, facilities that are qualified get a one-time investment to finance medicines and basic equipment, strengthening the work environment (KIs 5, 6, 12, 15, 16).\n\nPBF also increases the importance of recordkeeping. Notwithstanding the intervention's use of the existing registers, we can still expect a small increase in the workload \\[[@B49-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. The intervention also encourages the use of the records for facility planning and management, which is strengthened through coaching and training and introduction of the \"business plan\" (KIs 5, 6, 9, 11, 13). Not only does the facility management receive support, the intervention also incentivizes more supervision of the health workers by the district health management team, leading to more resources (KIs 13 and 15). The intervention introduces extra visits to verify the indicators, which impacts the workload and resources needed (KI 12). The verification also introduces a tendency for supervision along the lines of a checklist based on the national guidelines (KI 13).\n\nThe intervention does not give a specific role to the community other than what already existed, namely \"co-managing\" the facility in the health unit management committee (KIs 1, 2, 4, 5, 11).\n\n3.9. Causal Loop Analysis {#sec3dot9-ijerph-14-01007}\n-------------------------\n\nDepicting these different causal linkages in one diagram results in a very complex and difficult to interpret tangle of arrows (see [Figure 4](#ijerph-14-01007-f004){ref-type=\"fig\"}). However, causal loop analysis is about discovering the reinforcing and balancing feedback loops within a system, and using the appropriate command in the software easily lifts out these different loops. In this section, we will discuss three loops that can be used as a hypothesis for theory-driven evaluation. To clarify the loops, we have simplified the general diagram by focusing on the specific loop, deleting some variables and arrows, and bringing some variables together in one box.\n\n### 3.9.1. Hypothesis 1: \"Success to the Successful\" {#sec3dot9dot1-ijerph-14-01007}\n\n[Figure 5](#ijerph-14-01007-f005){ref-type=\"fig\"} depicts two reinforcing loops (R1 and R2) that together resemble one of the eight archetypes of systems thinking, the \"success to the successful\" systems archetype \\[[@B50-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. It starts with the one-time investment improving the work environment (basic equipment and stock of medicine), which positively influences the motivation and performance of the health workers \\[[@B49-ijerph-14-01007],[@B51-ijerph-14-01007],[@B52-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. This leads to improvements in the health facility budget (R1), health care outcomes, and patient behavior (number of patients) (R2) \\[[@B53-ijerph-14-01007],[@B54-ijerph-14-01007]\\], with some delay in the latter. However, due to the improved financial accessibility, the number of patients improves immediately (KIs 1, 4, 7--9, 11--15) \\[[@B54-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. The improved work environment and health worker performance combined with the increased number of patients increases the health facility budget, which can trigger further improvements in the work environment (KIs 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11--14), closing the reinforcing feedback loop. An important influencing factor of this loop is the ability of the management team to plan well and to use the newly received funds in an efficient and effective way (KI 2) \\[[@B51-ijerph-14-01007],[@B55-ijerph-14-01007],[@B56-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\n### 3.9.2. Hypothesis 2: \"Growth and Underinvestment\" {#sec3dot9dot2-ijerph-14-01007}\n\n[Figure 6](#ijerph-14-01007-f006){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows that this \"success to successful\" loop (R) may be hampered by two balancing feedback loops; the increased number of patients also increases the workload, which puts both the work environment (B1) and motivation (B2) under stress (KIs 11, 12, 14, 15) \\[[@B52-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. This combination of loops corresponds to the \"growth and underinvestment\" archetype in systems thinking \\[[@B50-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\nMore specifically, the increased workload may reduce the quality of the work environment (B1) (KI 11). Though smaller investments can be covered by the increased resources, they may not be sufficient to tackle large-scale infrastructural improvements, such as a bigger ward (KIs 11, 14, 15). (Funds coming from the PBF project are not even allowed to be invested in new infrastructure). With the wards becoming too crowded, the quality decreases, leading to fewer funds from the PBF. Fewer funds may jeopardize the investments needed in the work environment, leading to lower health care outcomes. However, the effect on patients' perceptions will be delayed and a high number of patients remain, but the facility will only receive the reduced user fees and not the PBF incentives, as the quality will not be high enough (KI 11). In the worst-case scenario, the quality will decrease even more, eventually keeping the patients away and reducing the workload again, making it possible for the facility to perform again, eventually leading to an oscillating effect. Another possible outcome is that the facilities will increase the user fees again.\n\nThe increased workload also has a negative effect on health worker motivation and, consequently, their performance (B2) (KI 14) \\[[@B49-ijerph-14-01007],[@B57-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. If the health facilities do not have the opportunity to hire/receive more staff, the increased workload will serve as an important bottleneck.\n\n### 3.9.3. Hypothesis 3: \"the Supervision Conundrum\" {#sec3dot9dot3-ijerph-14-01007}\n\n[Figure 7](#ijerph-14-01007-f007){ref-type=\"fig\"} focuses on the supervision part of the causal loop diagram. Again, we can discern a balancing loop (B), which is fueled in this case by external input from the intervention. Adding the verification task impacts the workload of the supervisors and the resources available, and fuels the checklist rationale (KIs 12, 13, 15) \\[[@B58-ijerph-14-01007],[@B59-ijerph-14-01007],[@B60-ijerph-14-01007],[@B61-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. This may lead to less focus on the formative part of supervision \\[[@B61-ijerph-14-01007],[@B62-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Adding resources and reducing the workload may give more room for the formative part of the supervision (quality supervision), whereas strengthening the capacity of the verifiers will make them more capable of differentiating between their role as verifier and formative supervisor.\n\n4. Discussion {#sec4-ijerph-14-01007}\n=============\n\nTheory-driven evaluations start with stating the intervention's program theory, which is often inferred from the intervention documents or interviews with the implementers. However, the program theory is not always written down in documents, or even present in the minds of the implementers \\[[@B41-ijerph-14-01007]\\] and, even if it is, it is not always based on a thorough analysis of the existing local system or a deep understanding of the intervention. For example, many of the KIs mainly focused on the incentive part of the intervention and not on the introduction of the business plan, while the issues of increased workload and strained work environment were hardly touched upon. The proposed combination of theory-driven evaluation and CLD had great potential in helping evaluators and researchers identify possible program theories based on existing knowledge from the literature and insights from local stakeholders and KIs. It did this by clarifying links, assumptions, feedback loops, etc.\n\nWhen an evaluator endorses the complexity paradigm and theory-driven evaluation framework, we therefore advise the use of CLD to identify and visualize the intervention's program theories. These program theories can then serve as the basis for a theory-driven evaluation. Our case study of a PBF intervention in Uganda showed the potential of this methodological strategy, by pointing out possible bottlenecks but also roads to success. Importantly, our CLD does not start with mapping out the mechanisms of the intervention but with the pre-existing environment after which the intervention is being introduced in this environment. The observed added value of this strategy is that program theories and related hypotheses are firmly based on existing literature, the perceptions and ideas of the local stakeholders and KIs, and the local environment/system/context. The explicitness of each of the steps in the loops facilitates tracking and evaluation of the hypotheses, which makes them easily falsifiable and helps explain why expected effects materialize or not. Critiques of these hypotheses are also easier to formulate, as other researchers can point out flaws and adapt the causal loop diagram. As CLD makes it possible to focus on specific steps, it will help prioritize the debate and research. Finally, the approach will help distinguish between what systems thinking calls \"emergence\" (1 + 1 = 3) and a mere sequence of effects leading to a larger effect (1 + 1 = 2).\n\nOur causal loop analysis led to three hypotheses. The \"success to the successful\" hypothesis points to the potential of the PBF scheme to attract more patients to the facilities due to improved financial accessibility and improved work environment. Sufficient PBF funds compensate for the lower user fees, leading to improvements in the equipment and medicine stock, as seen in a Nigerian PBF scheme \\[[@B49-ijerph-14-01007],[@B51-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\nThe \"growth and underinvestment\" hypothesis somewhat tempers the euphoria of the first hypothesis, as it focuses on the stress the increased workload puts on health worker motivation and the work environment from a specific tipping point onwards, as observed in other PBF schemes \\[[@B49-ijerph-14-01007],[@B57-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Therefore, the performance is expected to improve until a workload limit is reached, but it will not be able to improve further unless additional investments are made.\n\nFinally, the \"supervision conundrum\" hypothesis raises the question of the ability of the supervisors to combine the additional verification role with their formative supervisor role without any loss of quality in the formative supervision. This may be due to a lack of time and resources, or due to the introduction of a new control-oriented checklist logic that may jeopardize more formative supervision. In a PBF scheme in Uganda, the extra verification role increased the workload significantly \\[[@B58-ijerph-14-01007]\\], and in Benin the increased workload interfered with \"one-on-one coaching and comprehensive feedback to providers\" \\[[@B61-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Janssen and colleagues found a lack of \"focus on the learning process\" in Rwanda \\[[@B62-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. While a study in Tanzania presented a mixed picture with supervision focusing initially on data collection, but soon evolving into a more proactive problem-solving kind of supervision \\[[@B63-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\nThough our study is limited in terms of scale and scope, the empirical findings used to build the causal loop diagram mirror those of other studies. In many other settings, health workers have been shown to perceive their salary as insufficient and strongly disapprove untimely payments \\[[@B55-ijerph-14-01007],[@B64-ijerph-14-01007],[@B65-ijerph-14-01007],[@B66-ijerph-14-01007],[@B67-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Interestingly, higher level Ugandan stakeholders (e.g., Ministry of Health, donors, religious medical board) acknowledge that investments in human resources for health should be prioritized \\[[@B68-ijerph-14-01007]\\] while also recognizing the importance of non-financial incentives \\[[@B66-ijerph-14-01007],[@B69-ijerph-14-01007],[@B70-ijerph-14-01007],[@B71-ijerph-14-01007],[@B72-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\nEven though our respondents highlighted the importance of the learning function of recordkeeping, other studies have found that records are often neglected and not correctly used as a tool to improve quality \\[[@B73-ijerph-14-01007],[@B74-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Thus, our respondents may adhere to the principle in words, but not in practice. This is somewhat confirmed by our interviews; respondents highlighted that retrieving the history of patients is useful but they could not recall the last time that they did so. Pirkle, Dumont and Zunzunegui \\[[@B73-ijerph-14-01007]\\] highlighted the importance of innovative technologies (e.g., ICT) in improving the use of data in care processes.\n\nWith regard to supervision, the preference for a more formative form of supervision instead of checklist-driven verification was also pointed out by Hernandez et al. \\[[@B75-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Yet, in line with the study by Bosch-Capblanch and Garner \\[[@B76-ijerph-14-01007]\\], we conclude that the latter is still too often the reality.\n\nThe reluctance of the health workers towards \"too much interference from the community\" was also observed in Kenia and Benin, though the informational role was very much appreciated and perceived to enhance motivation \\[[@B70-ijerph-14-01007]\\]. Drawing upon health workers' perceptions, the same study \\[[@B70-ijerph-14-01007]\\] also identified better equipment as main factor boosting performance, something that was also underscored by our interviewees. Our findings also confirm those of Rujumba et al. \\[[@B77-ijerph-14-01007]\\] in Eastern Uganda; their study pointed out that the perceived high workload is considered problematic. Yet, as Maestad, Torsvik and Aakvik \\[[@B44-ijerph-14-01007]\\] found, workload is a subjective concept and sometimes exaggerated by the health workers. Importantly, a Nigerian study found that PBF improved the working environment and, consequently, the morale of the health workers while simultaneously increasing the number of patients, the time needed for recordkeeping, and the workload \\[[@B49-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\nFinally, the main barriers to the use of quality health care services, specifically maternal health care, highlighted by our respondents echoed those found by studies in Nigeria \\[[@B78-ijerph-14-01007]\\], Malawi \\[[@B79-ijerph-14-01007]\\], and Vietnam \\[[@B80-ijerph-14-01007]\\].\n\n5. Conclusions {#sec5-ijerph-14-01007}\n==============\n\nThis paper examined the use of a methodological strategy that uses CLD as a way to identify relevant hypotheses to be used in a theory-driven evaluation of a PBF intervention in Western Uganda. Importantly, the CLD refrains from a specific intervention-focus and starts with mapping out the pre-existing environment after which the intervention is being introduced in it. This introduction into the diagram is based on insights from key informants and knowledge from the literature. We feel that, being a reform package affecting multiple aspects of the health system, PBF and the evaluation of PBF can strongly benefit from this methodology.\n\nWe identified three important hypotheses: \"success to the successful\", \"growth and underinvestment\", and the \"supervision conundrum\". The first hypothesis means that the initial investment in the facility will lead to an improvement of the work environment and consequently of the quality score of the facility, which will lead to more funds and an even better work environment. The second hypothesis relates to the fact that an increased number of patients puts extra pressure on the work environment (e.g., the available space) and the health workers (increased workload) which may bring down the quality if not compensated with new investments. The final hypothesis highlights the danger of adding an extra verification task to the job description of the supervisors. This may crowd out the support supervision, due to an increase of the workload, less resources and the introduction of a checklist logic. These hypotheses are limited by the available information and the views of the researcher, KIs, and local stakeholders. Yet, using CLD renders the hypotheses more understandable and easier to trace during a theory-driven evaluation.\n\nThis work was supported by a PhD grant of the Flemish Interuniversity Council (VLIR) (VLADOC2014PR008).

        "text": "You Won’t Believe What Happened Hours After The GOP Debate\n\nThe second GOP debate happened last night, and hours later, the entire race has changed.\n\nEarlier today, we reported that Donald Trump had been declared the undisputed winner of the debate. However, there is someone gaining on the frontrunner who nobody saw coming. According to Drudge, Carly Fiorina is now polling in second place after the debate, coming in at 20%.\n\nThough she is still way behind Trump, who is currently polling in at 54%, this has been quite a comeback for a woman who didn’t even make the top ten for the first debate a few weeks ago. While Trump’s numbers are plateauing, Fiorina’s are getting bigger and bigger everyday, and her performance in last night’s debate definitely helped her cause.\n\nThough all the candidates were trying to attack Trump last night, Fiorina is arguably the only one who got anywhere. Fiorina was able to go toe to toe with Trump, proving that she is a strong leader who is not someone who can be messed with. This is in stark contrast to Jeb Bush, who looked weak and pathetic as he tried to take on Trump.\n\nWhile Trump is still the undisputed frontrunner, he now has himself some competition. It’s safe to say he didn’t see Fiorina coming, but he’s definitely paying attention to her now!\n\nWhat do you think about this? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section."

        "text": "Structural Modeling of γ-Secretase Aβ n Complex Formation and Substrate Processing.\nThe intramembrane aspartyl protease γ-secretase (GSEC) cleaves single-span transmembrane helices including the C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This substrate is initially cleaved at the ϵ-site followed by successive processing (trimming) events mostly in steps of three amino acids. GSEC is responsible for the formation of N-terminal APP amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides of different length (e.g., Aβ42) that can form aggregates involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The molecular mechanism of GSEC-APP substrate recognition is key for understanding how different peptide products are formed and could help in designing APP-selective modulators. Based on the known structure of apo GSEC and the APP-C99 fragment we have generated putative structural models of the initial binding in three different possible modes using extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The binding mode with the substrate helix located in a cleft between the transmembrane helices 2 and 3 of the presenilin subunit was identified as a most likely binding mode. Based on this arrangement, the processing steps were investigated using restraint MD simulations to pull the scissile bond (for each processing step) into a transition like (cleavable) state. This allowed us to analyze in detail the motions and energetic contributions of participating residues. The structural model agrees qualitatively well with the influence of many mutations in GSEC and C99. It also explains the effects of inhibitors, cross-linking, as well as spectroscopic data on GSEC substrate binding and can serve as working model for the future planning of structural and biochemical studies."

        "text": "WASHINGTON — The number of people seeking unemployment benefits rose last week to a seasonally adjusted 377,000, up from a nearly four-year low the previous week. But the longer-term trend is pointing to a healthier job market.\n\nApplications have trended down over the past few months. The four week average has declined to 377,500. When applications fall consistently below 375,000, it tends to signal that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.\n\nSome economists say the figures suggest further job gains ahead.\n\nThe nation has added at least 100,000 jobs for six straight months. And the unemployment rate has declined to 8.5 percent, its lowest in almost three years.\n\nSeparately, orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose as companies spent more on computers, machinery and other equipment. The Commerce Department said Thursday that durable goods orders rose 3 percent last month.\n\nStock market futures rose after the durable goods report.\n\n“There is more horsepower to this economy than most believe,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. “The stars are aligned right for a meaningful economic recovery.”\n\nThe number of first-time unemployment applications rose 21,000 last week, the Labor Department said. Applications had plummeted two weeks ago to their lowest level since April 2008.\n\nThe average has fallen about 9 percent since Oct. 1.\n\nUnemployment applications have been particularly volatile this month because employers have cut temporary workers hired for the holidays. The department adjusts for seasonal trends. But doing so accurately can be difficult.\n\nBut underneath all the volatility, applications have leveled off in recent weeks.\n\nSteven Wood, an economist at Insight Economics, said the longer-term trend suggests that the January jobs report, to be released next week, will show a “solid gain” in hiring.\n\n“The labor market is improving, albeit slowly,” Wood said in a note to clients.\n\nEconomists forecast that the nation will gain about 160,000 jobs a month in 2012, according to a survey of economists by the Associated Press. That’s up from an average of about 135,000 last year.\n\nA better outlook for job growth has coincided with other signs of improvement in the economy. Factory output jumped in December, and consumer confidence and spending have risen. Even the battered housing market has shown some signs of slight improvement.\n\nStill, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it expects growth to remain modest this year. And it forecasts only gradual declines the unemployment rate.\n\nThe Fed predicts the unemployment rate could fall as low as 8.2 percent by the end of 2012. The economy will likely expand about 2.5 percent this year.\n\nThe job market has a long way to go before it fully recovers from the damage of the Great Recession, which wiped out 8.7 million jobs. More than 13 million people remain unemployed. Millions more have given up looking for work and so are no longer counted as unemployed.\n\nGrowth could slow this year. Europe is almost certain to fall into recession because of its financial troubles. And wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. That makes it harder for consumers to spend more, potentially limiting growth."

        "text": "Senior defenseman Nick Cvetanovski smiles during pregame warmups Feb. 17. Cvetanovski is in his fourth year on varsity.\n\nPhoto by Patricia O’Blenes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMACOMB TOWNSHIP — When the spotlight is brightest, Bob Hall knows who to trust.\n\nThe Utica Eisenhower hockey coach called this current roster one of the most talented teams the program has ever seen. However, when a crucial moment presents itself, Hall taps senior co-captains Matt Haist and Nick Cvetanovski to head over the boards.\n\nAt press time, Ike was 16-4-2 overall and had finished off a perfect 6-0 mark in the Macomb Area Conference Red Division.\n\n“We rely on them; they’re our horses,” Hall said after a Feb. 16 practice at Suburban Ice Macomb. “They show up to play every single day. That’s not to say we don’t have other players that contribute widely, but our senior captains are a big part of our success.”\n\nHall’s words rang true the following day as Ike secured the top spot in the MAC Red with a 3-2 overtime victory against Macomb Dakota. The win secured back-to-back league titles for the Eagles, fueled by a goal from Cventanovski and a pair of assists from Haist, including a helper on the game-winner.\n\nThe tally gave Cvetanovski, the club’s top defenseman, his third goal of the season. The blue-liner has also pitched in eight assists during the campaign.\n\n“(Cvetanovski) brings a needed physical presence because he’s such a strong kid,” Hall said. “He has a cannon, probably the hardest shot around, and honestly I wish he’d shoot more. He puts the program first all the time and is a true gentleman on and off the ice. He’s a great leader for us.”\n\nIke’s top defenseman said he takes pride in his leadership role.\n\n“I just try to keep our guys accountable and on track, making sure we’re doing what we’re supposed to be doing,” explained Cvetanovski, who is a four-year varsity player. “Our defense has great chemistry and is hardworking. We get the pucks deep and try to keep things simple to get the job done.”\n\nWhile Cvetanovski is tasked with moving the puck out of the zone and securing breakouts, Haist is trusted to light the lamp. Playing left wing, he has answered the call with a team-leading 57 points.\n\n“(Haist) is just a natural goal-scorer. Sometimes we look at each other on the bench in amazement with what he can do with the puck,” Hall said. “Teams try to contain him, but he still finds ways to put the puck in the net and set up his teammates. He just has a knack for the net, and that’s a hard thing to teach in this game, but it’s natural for him.”\n\nIn his second varsity season, Haist has registered 39 goals and 18 assists. His nine power-play goals also lead the team.\n\n“Our guys are great on the breakout, and we have guys like (Cvetanovski) with big shots from the point, so I try to put those in,” Haist explained. “We work well out there as a team and really mesh well. Our chemistry comes from playing a lot of games together, and we know where we’re supposed to be out there.”\n\nHaist said he also relishes wearing the “C” on his jersey. Along with Cvetanovski and assistant captains Reyse Valicevic and Chris Burkhardt, Haist believes they have created a strong leadership trust.\n\n“We just try to get the guys ready and make sure everything falls into place,” Haist said. “Our team play is strong, and we work together to win games. I think we all lead well together, and we just want to win games. If we can make it all the way, that’s the goal.”\n\nCvetanovski agreed, believing the Eagles can make a postseason push.\n\n“I think we can get far in the playoffs,” Cvetanovski said. “We’re a hardworking team that does really well with all the little things. We know what we need to do.”\n\nThe club will next see action against Beverly Hills Detroit Country Day at 7 p.m. Feb. 23 at Southfield Sports Arena before returning home to take on Novi High at 6:30 p.m. Feb. 24."

        "text": "The ins and outs of amazing Spanish food, as told by two students who studied abroad.\n\nGet Spoon University delivered to you\n\nYou tryna be tricky? That email doesn't look right.\n\nBy adding your email you agree to get updates about Spoon University Healthier\n\nAs my experience abroad in Spain comes to a close, I've been reflecting on the amazing times I've had, the great friends I've met, and of course, the delicious food I ate. Now scratch everything you know about Spanish food. Sure, you can get decent paella in Castilla y Leon, but not many people know where to get the best. Here are a few tips on where to find the best places to get your Spanish food fix, depending on the plate you desire.\n\n1. Paella\n\nSummer Tuman\n\nWhen you think of Spanish food, you probably think of paella first, like this shrimp paella. The most famous of Spanish foods is the one with the most flavor. You can get paella almost anywhere across the country, but the best paella is in Valencia. This is because of La Albufera, a body of water in the province of Valencia that gives the land the perfect texture for growing rice. Also, because of its location next to the Mediterranean, the fresh Valencian seafood makes for a great dish of seafood paella.\n\n2. Jamón Iberico (Iberian Ham)\n\nEmily Chaisson\n\nIn Spain there are many different types of jamon: jamon serrano, jamon curado, jamon reserva and of course, the most famous, jamon iberico. While you might think you're getting the best jamon iberico in the Spanish capital of Madrid, you'd be mistaken. The best jamon iberico comes from the province of Salamanca (represent!) in Castilla y Leon; more specifically the town of Guijuelo. The pigs in Guijuelo are called \"Pata Negra\", basically black-footed. What makes this type of jamon so rich is the fact that the pigs are given acorns as a part of their diet. Yes, acorns. And Guijuelo has a ton of them.\n\n3. Gazpacho\n\nSummer Tuman\n\nTranslated to English as \"cold tomato soup,\" gazpacho is definitely a fan-favorite Spanish dish. But what you didn't know is that the best gazpacho comes from the region of Andalucia, and that it is usually only eaten in the summertime. That's because it gets so hot in Andalucia, and the locals need something to cool themselves down. Queue the gazpacho. Try making your own using this recipe.\n\n4. Cava (Spanish Champagne)\n\nSummer Tuman\n\nCava is a champagne that is from the Catalunya region. It's a very popular drink to have in Barcelona and is super cheap (just like every other type of wine in Spain).\n\n5. Sidra (Hard Cider)\n\nEmily Chaisson\n\nLa Sidra, or Spanish hard cider, is commonly enjoyed during Navidades (Christmas season). But for the rest of the year it is a typical drink in the province of Asturias in the north of Spain. Make sure you don't miss the show!\n\n6. Fabada\n\nImage from WikiCommons\n\nAnother typical dish of Asturias is Fabada. Known for its density, this stew is filled with beans, bacon, chorizo, ham, and sausage. It's commonly eaten during the winter months to help keep people warm. Talk about filling.\n\nBelow are some typical Spanish foods you can get virtually anywhere. These are important delicacies that everyone must try, no matter which Spanish city or province you find yourself in."

Defendant appeals, contending that he was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In the alternative defendant contends that he should be resentenced because his sentencing hearing was unfair and improper in that the trial court heard and considered improper evidence in aggravation and because he was improperly sentenced to extended term and consecutive sentences.\n*603 The complaining witness, M.M., age 23, testified that she left her apartment to go shopping about 11 a.m. on January 2, 1986. She took a bus to the intersection of Milwaukee and Division in Chicago, walked to a store where she made a purchase and then walked back to the bus stop to wait for the bus.\nAs complainant waited for the bus, she was approached by a man later identified as defendant. He asked her name and then asked if she wanted to \"get high.\" After she responded in the negative, he asked her to go with him. When she again refused, he walked over to her, told her that he had a gun and partially exposed an object from his right jacket pocket which complainant thought was the grip of a gun. Because defendant also threatened to kill her if she did not do as he told her, she accompanied defendant and walked down the street with him arm in arm, as he instructed her to do.\nThey continued to walk together for about one mile until they arrived at an abandoned building. Defendant then instructed complainant to enter this building and go into the basement. Complainant cried and begged him to let her go, but he told her he would kill her if she refused. She then entered the basement of the building, where she found some old furniture and a bed. Defendant told her to pull down her slacks and panties and remove one leg. He then instructed her to sit on the edge of the bed. Defendant then knelt down on the floor between her legs. He kept his right hand inside the jacket pocket, where he had the gun he had shown her. He then licked her vagina for several minutes. After this he unzipped the front of his pants, removed his penis and placed it inside her vagina. After about five minutes complainant felt \"something wet,\" and she believed defendant ejaculated. Defendant then got up and zipped up his pants.\nWhen defendant had finished, he instructed complainant to remove her pants and panties and he asked her for money. She told him that she had none, and he responded that she was lying. He then searched her pants pockets and, finding nothing, instructed her to remove her boots and her socks. When he still did not find any money, he told her to empty her coat pockets. These, too, were empty so he told her to unfasten her coat and her blouse. He placed his hand inside her bra in search of money. When the money that was hidden there fell out, he took the money, except for one dollar, which he left for her bus fare. He then hid her clothing and told her to count to 20 before she started searching for her clothes. Defendant then left the building.\nComplainant found all of her clothing except her panties. She dressed, left the building, and went to a nearby store where she *604 called the police to report what had happened. After the police arrived and spoke with her, they returned with her to the abandoned building so that she could identify the building and the basement area where she had been taken. Complainant was then taken to the hospital, where she was examined. In court complainant identified some photographs which were taken by the police depicting the abandoned building and the basement area within.\nComplainant further testified that on November 19, 1986, she was shopping with friends on Milwaukee Avenue near Wolcott. As she was walking in this area, she heard a man yell, \"Hey slim, want to get high?\" Complainant turned and recognized defendant. She then quickly turned her head and immediately entered a store, where she asked to use the telephone. The store clerk refused to allow her to use the telephone but directed her to a nearby public telephone. Complainant left the store after she waited for defendant to pass by the area and walked toward the public telephone. Just then she saw a police car and flagged down the officers. She informed the police that she had been raped in January of that year and then pointed out defendant as the man who had been her attacker. The officers approached defendant and arrested him. When defendant was inside the police car, complainant positively identified defendant as the man who had attacked her in January.\nIt was later stipulated that complainant was examined at the hospital by Nurse Kathleen Shanahan and Dr. Gonzales and that samples were taken for a Vitullo Kit. It was also stipulated that Christine Anderson of the Chicago police crime lab received these samples through a proper chain of custody and that she would testify that the samples tested positive for the presence of sperm. Finally, Officer Vincent Mancini testified in corroboration of complainant's testimony that about 2 p.m. on November 19, 1986, he was flagged down while on routine patrol in the area of 1400 North Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago and that as a result of the information provided to him by complainant, defendant was arrested.\nDefendant presented the testimony of Ed Matthews, an investigator for the public defender's office. He testified that on August 3, 1987, he and another investigator, along with defense counsel, went to 630 West Evergreen Street to interview the complainant. After they identified themselves, she agreed to talk with them. She then told them that defendant had approached her as she waited for a bus at the bus stop and that defendant told her that he had a gun but that she only saw what appeared to be the handle of a gun. They then walked arm in arm for several blocks until they reached an *605 abandoned building. Inside this building defendant told her to take down her pants. Matthews testified that complainant then indicated that defendant performed oral sex but did not have intercourse because he could not get an erection. After this defendant told her to count to 20 and then left the building.\nAfter hearing argument the trial court found defendant guilty of criminal sexual assault based on contact between defendant's mouth and the victim's vagina. The court found defendant not guilty of all other charges, including the counts alleging aggravated criminal sexual assault, aggravated kidnapping and aggravated unlawful restraint, having found that there was no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had carried a gun. The trial court also found defendant not guilty of armed robbery for this reason, but found defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of robbery.\nAt the subsequent sentencing hearing the trial court ruled admissible, over defendant's objection, the testimony of six witnesses. Three of these witnesses were Chicago police officers who testified regarding the circumstances surrounding four of defendant's prior arrests for solicitation. One witness, Stephanie Barnett, was defendant's ex-girlfriend, who testified concerning the circumstances leading up to defendant's arrest for indecent liberties with a child, a charge to which defendant later pleaded guilty. Barnett also testified regarding defendant's violation of the condition of his probation that he not have contact with her or her children. Specifically, she testified that she called the police to have defendant arrested on September 29, 1984, and on December 25, 1984, when he entered her residence without her permission. On both occasions defendant and Barnett engaged in physical altercations which resulted in injury to Barnett.\nFinally, two other Chicago police officers testified that when they responded to Barnett's residence they attempted to arrest defendant, that defendant resisted arrest and tried to escape and that defendant fought with the officers. Furthermore, on December 25, 1984, when defendant resisted arrest, he caused physical injury to several police officers.\nCertified copies of defendant's prior convictions for indecent liberties and battery were admitted along with the presentence investigation report. No evidence in mitigation was offered. The trial court then found defendant eligible for an extended term and consecutive sentences and sentenced defendant to a term of 15 years for the criminal sexual assault conviction and a term of four years for the robbery conviction, to be served consecutively.\n*606 The first issue on appeal is whether the complaining witness' testimony was sufficient to have proven defendant guilty of the offenses for which he was convicted beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant contends that his acquittal on the counts charging him with aggravated criminal sexual assault, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint, and criminal sexual assault based on penile penetration indicated that the complaining witness was not credible and, therefore, he should have been acquitted of all charges. We cannot agree.\n 1 The trial court explicitly found the complaining witness to be credible. It is the duty of the trier of fact to assess the credibility of the witnesses, weigh the evidence and resolve any conflicts in the testimony. (People v. Akis (1976), 63 Ill.2d 296, 347 N.E.2d 733.) Having had the opportunity to view the witnesses, the trial court is in a much better position to make the credibility assessment, and the trial court's decision will not be disturbed unless the evidence is so palpably improbable or unsatisfactory that a reasonable doubt as to defendant's guilt exists. People v. Ellis (1978), 74 Ill.2d 489, 384 N.E.2d 331.\n 2 In the present case the complaining witness testified clearly and convincingly regarding her encounter with defendant and the subsequent sexual assault. The complaining witness also candidly admitted that she never saw the gun that defendant indicated that he was carrying, but that she saw a handle of what she believed to be a gun. The evidence presented by defendant did not impeach the complaining witness regarding these matters, but rather, corroborated much of her testimony. The testimony admitted by defendant raised a conflict only on the issue of penile penetration. The mere fact that the trial court resolved this conflict in favor of defendant does not, in our mind, diminish the credibility of the complaining witness. Nor does the fact that the trial court chose to give defendant the benefit of the doubt on the issue of the presence of a weapon in any way affect our assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence supporting defendant's conviction for criminal sexual assault and robbery. Because we agree with the trial court that the complaining witness was credible and that her testimony was clear and convincing, her testimony was sufficient to support defendant's convictions beyond a reasonable doubt and so we affirm. People v. Johnson (1987), 161 Ill. App.3d 551, 515 N.E.2d 137.\nHaving affirmed defendant's convictions, we must address defendant's second issue and determine whether his sentencing hearing was conducted properly and whether an extended term and consecutive *607 sentences were properly imposed. The first question is whether defendant received a fair sentencing hearing. Defendant challenges the admission of the testimony of five witnesses because they testified to \"mere arrests\" as opposed to convictions. Defendant also contends that this testimony was unreliable because it \"painted a distorted picture\" of him as a sexual pervert.\n 3-5 It has long been held that a sentencing judge will be given wide latitude in his discretionary determination of the types and sources of evidence that may be admitted to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within the statutory limits. (People v. Foster (1987), 119 Ill.2d 69, 96, 518 N.E.2d 82; People v. Adkins (1968), 41 Ill.2d 297, 300, 242 N.E.2d 258.) The only requirement for admission is that the evidence be reliable and relevant, and this is a decision left to the discretion of the sentencing court. (People v. Lyles (1985), 106 Ill.2d 373, 414, 478 N.E.2d 291.) Evidence of other crimes with which defendant has been charged but not convicted is admissible, especially when the testimony concerning such criminal activity or misconduct is trustworthy and subject to cross-examination. (People v. Johnson (1989), 128 Ill.2d 253, 284, 538 N.E.2d 1118; People v. Sanchez (1986), 115 Ill.2d 238, 503 N.E.2d 277; People v. La Pointe (1981), 88 Ill.2d 482, 498-99, 431 N.E.2d 344.) The relaxation of the formal rules of evidence at the sentencing stage is intended to provide the sentencing judge with a wide range of information concerning the defendant's life, character, criminal history and propensity to continue to commit other offenses. (People v. Johnson (1989), 128 Ill.2d 253, 538 N.E.2d 1118; People v. Sanchez (1986), 115 Ill.2d 238, 503 N.E.2d 277.) Even hearsay evidence is not per se inadmissible at a sentencing hearing. (People v. Foster (1987), 119 Ill.2d 69, 98, 518 N.E.2d 82; People v. Hall (1986), 114 Ill.2d 376, 417, 499 N.E.2d 1335; People v. Perez (1985), 108 Ill.2d 70, 86-87, 483 N.E.2d 250.) A hearsay objection will go to the weight and not the admissibility. (People v. Foster, 119 Ill.2d at 98.) Double hearsay, however, should be corroborated, at least in part, by other evidence. People v. Foster, 119 Ill.2d at 98.\n 6 In the present case the evidence of other criminal misconduct which did not result in conviction was properly admitted. The arresting officers testified and were subject to cross-examination. The evidence was trustworthy and provided some insight into defendant's life, character and criminal propensities. As such it was relevant and reliable and, thus, properly admitted and considered by the sentencing judge.\n 7 The testimony of Barnett concerning her daughter's statements *608 to her about defendant's sexual misconduct, although hearsay, was corroborated in part by the certified copy of defendant's conviction for the offense of indecent liberties with a child. There was no error in its admission. In conclusion, defendant received a fair sentencing hearing at which proper evidence in aggravation was received.\n 8 We now consider whether defendant was eligible for an extended-term sentence and consecutive sentences as the trial court held. At the time of defendant's sentencing in December 1987, the statute provided:\n\"[T]he following factors may be considered by the court as reasons to impose an extended term sentence under Section 5-8-2 upon any offender who was at least 17 years old on the date the crime was committed:\n(1) When a defendant is convicted of any felony, after having been previously convicted in Illinois of the same or greater class felony, within 10 years, excluding time spent in custody, and such charges are separately brought and tried and arise out of different series of acts.\" Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, par. 1005-5-3.2(b).\nDefendant was convicted of a Class 1 felony of indecent liberties with a child on August 3, 1983. This conviction was within 10 years of his present conviction for a criminal sexual assault, another Class 1 felony. Accordingly, defendant was eligible for an extended term.\n 9 Although defendant apparently does not dispute this conviction or the fact that he was eligible for an extended term within the language of the statute, defendant contends that an extended term was improperly imposed because the sentencing judge relied on improperly admitted evidence. There are two reasons that we reject defendant's argument. First, although the trial court found that defendant was eligible for an extended-term sentence, it sentenced defendant to a term of 15 years' imprisonment, which is the maximum normal sentence within the range for sentencing for a Class 1 felony. Thus, although the trial court correctly determined that defendant was eligible for an extended-term sentence, the actual sentence imposed did not exceed the statutory range for the conviction. Thus, technically defendant was not sentenced to an extended-term sentence. Secondly, we found earlier that all the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing was properly admitted and, therefore, the sentence, whether it is considered an extended term or not, could not have been imposed in reliance on improperly admitted evidence.\n 10 The last issue is whether consecutive sentencing was available *609 and appropriate in this case. Whether consecutive or concurrent sentences should be imposed is a determination left to the sound discretion of the court, as long as the decision does not conflict with the statutory regulations concerning the imposition of such sentences. Section 5-8-4 of the Unified Code of Corrections (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, par. 1005-8-4) sets forth the applicable authority with regard to consecutive sentencing. It states:\n\"(a) When multiple sentences of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time, or when a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to sentence in this State or in another state, or for a sentence imposed by any district court of the United States, the sentences shall run concurrently or consecutively as determined by the court. * * * The court shall not impose consecutive sentences for offenses which were committed as part of a single course of conduct during which there was no substantial change in the nature of the criminal objective, unless, one of the offenses for which defendant was convicted was a Class X or Class 1 felony and the defendant inflicted severe bodily injury, in which event the court may enter sentences to run consecutively. Sentences shall run concurrently unless otherwise specified by the court.\n(b) The court shall not impose a consecutive sentence unless, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and character of the defendant, it is of the opinion that such a term is required to protect the public from further criminal conduct by the defendant, the basis for which the court shall set forth in the record.\" Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 38, par. 1005-8-4.\nDefendant argues that consecutive sentences were improperly imposed in this instance because the criminal sexual assault and robbery were part of the same course of conduct and that there was no substantial change in the nature of the criminal objective. Defendant also contends that his background and character did not warrant a finding that consecutive terms of imprisonment were necessary to protect the public from future criminal conduct. We disagree with defendant's position and find that the trial court's imposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment was proper.\n 11 When consecutive sentences are imposed pursuant to law and supported by the record, they will not be disturbed on review. (People v. Holland (1987), 121 Ill.2d 136, 520 N.E.2d 270; People v. Steppan (1985), 105 Ill.2d 310, 473 N.E.2d 1300.) In the present *610 case the State argued in favor of consecutive sentences at the sentencing hearing, stating that the criminal sexual assault and robbery were two separate and distinct courses of conduct and that society needed to be protected from defendant based upon his criminal background and character. The trial court later stated that it considered all the facts and circumstances of the case at bar and the defendant's background and found that defendant was eligible to be sentenced to consecutive terms and that this was appropriate in this case. We find ample support in the record for this determination.\n 12 The record shows that the criminal sexual assault and subsequent robbery were two separate courses of action. The complaining witness testified that defendant approached her and forced her to accompany him to an abandoned building. His objective at that time was clearly to engage in the criminal sexual assault. It was not until he completed this objective that he demanded money from the victim and caused her to undress so he could search for her hidden cash. Furthermore, the extensive testimony concerning defendant's prior criminal conduct demonstrated clearly that consecutive sentencing was appropriate in this instance since society would be better protected from defendant's future criminal conduct. Thus, we find that the imposition of consecutive sentences in this case was proper. See People v. Holland (1987), 121 Ill.2d 136, 520 N.E.2d 270; People v. Rose (1979), 75 Ill. App.3d 45, 393 N.E.2d 698.\nThe judgment of the circuit court of Cook County is affirmed. In addition, pursuant to People v. Nicholls (1978), 71 Ill.2d 166, 374 N.E.2d 194, we assess defendant $50 as costs for this appeal.\nJudgment affirmed.\nBUCKLEY, P.J., and O'CONNOR, J., concur.\n"

        "text": "Expansion Tank fails repeatedly\n\nI have a setup for radiant floor and DHW running on a Munchkin boiler. It all works great, with one exception. In five years I've gone through 3 expansion tanks! Each time, the tank fails by rusting through from the inside. I cannot believe I would get 3 defective tanks (they were bought at different times, from different vendors, but all same manufacturer).\n\nI've tried to include some photos to show the setup.\n\nHere is my theory: the tank that fails is at a low spot in the system (not the lowest spot, but close). The boiler and DHW are connected with black pipe, and the radiant zone pumps with copper. There are proper dielectric unions between them. Perhaps the iron pipe is corroding slightly, and the sediment is falling into the expansion tank, somehow causing excessive corrosion inside the tank? Does this make sense?\n\nSo, do I replace all the black pipe with copper? I am afraid there may be damage to the boiler that I cannot see, because that is truly the low point in the system. Would a trap or filter solve the problem?\n\nBy the way, there are 2 expansion tanks on the system, one up high near the inlet and one near the radiant manifold. It is only the one near the radiant that fails.\n\nComments\n\nFor example, Uponor make HePEX Plus, and AquaPEX. HePEX is OK with mild steel components, but AquaPEX is not...\n\nME\n\nIt's not so much a case of \"You got what you paid for\", as it is a matter of \"You DIDN'T get what you DIDN'T pay for, and you're NOT going to get what you thought you were in the way of comfort\". Borrowed from Heatboy.\n\nI do not know who made the tubing, but it was described as \"POLY PXC\" tubing (7/8\"). I can tell you that it is NOT an oxygen barrier tubing. That may have been a mistake, but it is too late now. I would welcome any suggestions to minimize the deterioration.\n\nFortunately, any components that would fail are accessible, i.e. the expansion tank and any steel piping in the near boiler piping configuration.\n\nYou could maintain the pH above 8.0 and it would slow any oxygen degradation. As for the tank replace it with a potable water expansion tank, which is rated for oxygen. Adjust the diaphragm pressure to around 12 to 15 PSI, assuming no more than a 2 story building.\n\nThe next components to start showing sign would be any steel pipe, then cast iron pump.\n\nME\n\nIt's not so much a case of \"You got what you paid for\", as it is a matter of \"You DIDN'T get what you DIDN'T pay for, and you're NOT going to get what you thought you were in the way of comfort\". Borrowed from Heatboy.\n\nIt's not so much a case of \"You got what you paid for\", as it is a matter of \"You DIDN'T get what you DIDN'T pay for, and you're NOT going to get what you thought you were in the way of comfort\". Borrowed from Heatboy.\n\nreplace the expansion tank with a rubber lined tank designed for domestic water. the air pressure should be adjusted down before installing, but this will eliminate corrosion in that part of the system.\n\n1. Replace expansion tanks with potable models, ask HTP how to make a munchkin handle o2 permeated water such as in an open system (there are parts that need replacing, I believe), replace all of your pumps either with non ferrous models or with a non ferrous system pump or two with zone valves (I'd go with the zone valves, cheaper up front and cheaper to run as well judging by your current massively overpumped sitaution), and replace any iron with copper.\n\n2. Find a good corrosion inhibitor water treatment and use it. We don't do this so I am not familiar with the options there. But with this many pumps, this is probably your least expensive route.\n\nCurious Rob, why don't you offer water treatment as a part and parcel of your \"system\" designs?\n\nFor guidance, I'd suggest Rhomar Water, speak with Dwight Hedgepeth.\n\nME\n\nIt's not so much a case of \"You got what you paid for\", as it is a matter of \"You DIDN'T get what you DIDN'T pay for, and you're NOT going to get what you thought you were in the way of comfort\". Borrowed from Heatboy.\n\nwe only do closed systems, and in something like 1000 active projects water treatment might have helped only 1 avoid a problem that I'm aware of (that one has a gunked up PBV and flow screen, cleaning might have helped). so I haven't seen the urgency or utility of making water treatment standard.\n\nThe amount of black pipe & possible corrosion is making me nervous. I am not worried about a hole in a pipe -- I know that would take a very long time to develop.\n\nWhat worries me is the gunk & debris that might be flowing around inside the system. I can't change the tubing, and I will look into the chemical treatment option. In the meantime, would it be smart to consider replacing all the black pipe with copper? I know that's very expensive, but am I looking at bigger problems down the road?\n\nbut that would include the pumps. I'm thinking that ongoing chemical treatment may be your best option, but that is just my opinion.\n\nAs has been stated, if you go that route, there are a few components in the boiler that are ferrous (the elbow going to the pressure relief valve, for example, is an black iron fitting).\n\nEven if you do change all components, you will still want to maintain a proper pH on the system. It just won't degrade as fast due to eliminating the oxidizables in the system.\n\nME\n\nIt's not so much a case of \"You got what you paid for\", as it is a matter of \"You DIDN'T get what you DIDN'T pay for, and you're NOT going to get what you thought you were in the way of comfort\". Borrowed from Heatboy.\n\nI hope you are covering your butt in paper making sure that SOMEONE addresses WQ issues, otherwise you could be co-named in a legal action if it were to become an issue.\n\nME\n\nIt's not so much a case of \"You got what you paid for\", as it is a matter of \"You DIDN'T get what you DIDN'T pay for, and you're NOT going to get what you thought you were in the way of comfort\". Borrowed from Heatboy.\n\nWell, the fortunate thing is that you have now identified the problem. The unfortunate thing is that you are going to have to do some re-piping to provide a \"fix\". You are going to have to seperate the boiler side of the system from the system side of the system by means of a heat exchanger. My choice would be a brazed plate exchanger. Go to a website such as Triangle Tube, and look at the sizing charts for your system. You should do this as soon as posible. The system will need to be flushed, and cleaned before putting it back into service. You should also use some kind of boiler water treatment, and check the water periodically for maintainence. The water, if left as is, will have the look, and consistence of brown gravy. That wont be good for air seperators, flow checks, hy vents, and of course degraded heat transfer in the system. Once the heat exchanger is in place, the system is flushed and cleaned, and a conditioner used, you should have an improved situation. And of course, I would have an experienced heating company do the upgrade, NOT the person who installed the system initially.\n\nI vote braze plate heat x, bronze or ss circ. Zone valves and ecm pump would be nice except I have yet to be impressed with any certain zv mfr. Don't know yet on Calleffi's reliability but do know on many others.\n\nWhile I am a fan of new technology, I have also seen enough come and go to be skeptical. I do agree with the bronze or stainless pumps, but be careful installing out of the ordinary components. Im not saying that ecm pumps are no good, but its no fun to get a call in the middle of the night to find that you are looking at a pump or controller that no one stocks. Make sure your supplier has the items in stock, and will continue to support the line. I had a job recently that the contractor had been sold on a Wilo pump for a very large apartment building, one pump, multiple zone valves. I advised him to use Taco pump instead, as everyone stocks the pump that would be on the job, so finding a replacement on a no heat call would be a snap. As far as Caleffi zone valves, we have been selling them for a while, and are having no problems with them."

During each performance, the audience at home is able to decide in real time whether or not a contestant is sent through to the next round by using a mobile voting app.\n\nWhile the viewers are considered the \"judges\", the expert panelists also may influence the vote, but with continuously decreasing percentage votes over the total public vote and not exceeding 5% of the total voting power.\n\nAuditions\nThe auditions are the first round where the acts are individually called to perform. As a reportage of the announced performer is shown, viewers are invited to register for voting for that specific act. Following a countdown of three seconds, the candidate has to start performing behind a screen called \"the wall\".\n\nWith the start of the performance, the voting kicks in. Registered voters have the option of voting just \"yes\" or \"no\". Non-votes are also considered \"no\" votes. If an expert votes \"yes\", another 5% is added to the tally of the contestant. The contestants also see random photos of voters in their favour. The faces of panelists voting \"yes\" are also shown in larger frames.\n\nOnce the contestant reaches 80% of \"yes\" votes, the wall is raised and the contestant goes to the next round of the competition.\n\nDuels\nContestants who make it through the auditions are paired by the judges to face off in a duel. The first contestant sings with the wall up and sets the benchmark for the second contestant. The second contestant sings with the wall down. If the second contestant betters the first contestant's vote total, the wall rises and the second contestant was through to the next round while the first contestant is eliminated; if the second contestant fails to raise the wall, the second contestant is eliminated and the first contestant goes through.\n\nSeries overview\n\nSee also:Rising Star (Indian season 4)\n\nColor key\n\nBannet Dosanjh  became India's first Rising Star, winning Rs. 20 lakhs and the opportunity to sing in a movie under Vishesh Films banner.

From an experimental point of view the transport properties of these systems in the presence of boundaries and potential scatterers are of particular interest. Recently several attempts have been made to describe such a situation: Using renormalization group techniques the transport properties of a 1D interacting electron gas in the presence of a potential barrier have been studied by Kane and Fisher [@kafi:92]. Their surprising findings triggered further work using different techniques like boundary conformal field theory [@card:89] and an exact solution by means of a mapping to the boundary sine-Gordon model [@Fendley; @tsve:95a]. In particular the low temperature properties of magnetic (Kondo) impurities in a Luttinger liquid [@Affleck; @FrojdhJ] have been investigated in great detail. In the present work we will investigate the effects of a particular type of potential impurity in a Luttinger liquid (where both spin-and charge degrees of freedom are gapless) by means of an exact solution through the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method (QISM) [@vladb].\n\nAttempts to study effects due to the presence of impurities in many-body quantum system in the framework of integrable models have a long successful history [@anjo:84; @LeeSchl; @Vega; @bares:95; @KondoBA]. As far as lattice models are concerned the underlying principle in these exact solutions is the fact that the QISM allows for the introduction of certain “inhomogeneities” into vertex models without spoiling integrability. The [*local*]{} vertices—so called ${\\cal L}$-operators—are objects depending on a complex valued spectral parameter acting on an auxiliary matrix space in addition to the quantum space of the model. They are solutions of a Yang-Baxter equation with an ${\\cal R}$ matrix which itself acts on two copies of the matrix space and depends on the difference of the corresponding spectral parameters only. This allows to to build families of vertex models with site-dependent shifts of the spectral parameters and even different quantum spaces on different sites. The first fact has been widely used in solving models for particles with an internal degree of freedom by means of the nested Bethe Ansatz [@yang:67]. The second approach has been first applied by Andrei and Johannesson to study the properties of an $S={1\\over2}$ Heisenberg chain with an additional site carrying spin $S$ [@anjo:84] (see also [@LeeSchl]).\n\nIn this letter we study the properties of the supersymmetric $t$–$J$ model with one vertex replaced by an ${\\cal L}$ operator acting on a four–dimensional quantum space. This preserves the $gl(2|1)$ supersymmetry of the model but at the same time lifts the restriction of no double occupancy present in the $t$–$J$ model at the impurity site. The existence of a free parameter in the four–dimensional representations of the superalgebra [@brax:94] allows to tune the coupling of the impurity to the host chain. As will be shown below, the present model allows to study some aspects of a more general situation than the ones mentioned above: the impurity introduced here couples to [*both*]{} spin- and charge degrees of freedom of the bulk Luttinger liquid. The extension of our calculation to the case of many impurities is straightforward.\n\nThe solution of the model is completely analogous to that of the pure $t$–$J$ model [@QISM_tJ]: The transfer matrix generating the hamiltonian and the other conserved quantities is the trace of a product of the local ${\\cal L}$ operators chosen as ${\\cal L}_{tJ}= (\\lambda+i\\Pi)/\n(\\lambda+i)$ for the regular sites ($\\Pi$ is a graded permutation operator acting on the tensor product of the auxiliary and the quantum space) and ${\\cal L}_{34}\\propto\\lambda-i({\\alpha \\over 2}+1)+i\\tilde{\\cal L}$ on the site associated to the impurity. Written as a matrix in the three dimensional auxiliary space $\\tilde{\\cal L}$ reads $$\\tilde{\\cal L}\\!\\!=\\!\\!\n  \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n  X_2^{\\downarrow \\downarrow}+X_2^{00} &\n  - X_2^{\\downarrow \\uparrow} &\n   Q_{\\uparrow}\n\\\\\n  - X_2^{\\uparrow \\downarrow} &\n  X_2^{\\uparrow \\uparrow}+X_2^{00} &\n  Q_{\\downarrow}    \n\\\\\n  Q^\\dagger_{\\uparrow} &    \n  Q^\\dagger_{\\downarrow} &  \n \\!\\alpha+  X_2^{\\uparrow \\uparrow}+X_2^{\\downarrow \\downarrow}+2 X_2^{00}\\!\\!\n\\end{array} \\right)\\!\\!.$$ Here $Q_{\\sigma}=\\sqrt{\\alpha+1}X_2^{0\n\\sigma}-\\sigma\\sqrt{\\alpha}X_2^{-\\sigma 2}$ with $\\sigma=\\pm$, where $+$ ($-$) corresponds to $\\uparrow$ ($\\downarrow$) and where the Hubbard projection operators are given by $X^{ab}=|a\\rangle\\langle b|$ with $a,b=\\uparrow,\\downarrow,2,0$. The hamiltonian is then given by the logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix at spectral parameter $\\lambda=0$. In general the form of this hamiltonian is rather complicated and will be given elsewhere [@bef:up]. In any case the precise form of the lattice (impurity) interactions is not essential as far as low-energy properties are concerned: in the continuum limit only a small number of terms with scaling dimensions smaller than two will survive (taking the continuum limit and identifying the scaling dimensions of the composite operators at the impurity site is rather nontrivial though). Physically the model describes an impurity with four allowed states (spin-up/down electrons, empty/doubly occupied site) that couples to two neighbouring $t$-$J$ sites and also modifies the interaction between the $t$-$J$ sites (see Fig. \\[fig:im.ps\\]). In the limiting cases $\\alpha\\to0(\\infty)$ the hamiltonian simplifies essentially: In the first case the impurity acts as a ordinary $t$–$J$ site in the ground state below half filling, for $\\alpha\\to\\infty$ the impurity site is doubly occupied and induces a twist in the boundary conditions of the host chain.\n\nThe eigenstates of the hamiltonian for $N_\\uparrow$ ($N_\\downarrow$) electrons with spin $\\uparrow$ ($\\downarrow$) are constructed by means of the nested algebraic Bethe Ansatz (NABA) leading to a system of algebraic equations for the spectral parameters $\\lambda_j$ ($j=1,\\ldots,N_e=\nN_\\uparrow + N_\\downarrow$) and $\\lambda_\\alpha^{(1)}$ ($\\alpha=1,\\ldots,N_\\downarrow$) $$\\begin{aligned}\n \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_j-{i\\over 2}}{\\lambda_j+{i\\over 2}} \\right)^{L}\n \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_j-{\\alpha+1 \\over 2}i}{\\lambda_j+{\\alpha+1 \\over 2}i}\n \\right) &=& \\prod^{N_\\downarrow}_{\\alpha=1} \\frac\n {\\lambda_j-\\lambda^{(1)}_\\alpha-{i\\over 2}}\n {\\lambda_j-\\lambda^{(1)}_\\alpha+{i\\over 2}}\\ , \\nonumber \\\\\n \\prod^{N_e}_{j=1} \\frac{\\lambda^{(1)}_\\alpha-\\lambda_j+{i\\over 2}}\n {\\lambda^{(1)}_\\alpha-\\lambda_j -{i\\over 2}} &=& -\n \\prod^{N_\\downarrow}_{\\beta=1}\n \\frac{\\lambda^{(1)}_\\alpha-\\lambda^{(1)}_\\beta+i}\n {\\lambda^{(1)}_\\alpha-\\lambda^{(1)}_\\beta-i}\\ .\n\\nonumber\\end{aligned}$$ The corresponding eigenvalues of the hamiltonian in the grand canonical ensemble are $E= -\\mu N_e -(H/2)(N_\\uparrow-N_\\downarrow)\n+\\sum_{j=1}^{N_e}{1/( \\lambda_j^2+{1\\over 4})}$.\n\nThe configuration of spectral parameters leading to the lowest energy state for given chemical potential and magnetic field are found in complete analogy to the pure $t$–$J$ chain: the ground state for finite $H$ is described by two filled Fermi seas of $\\lambda$-$\\lambda^{(1)}$-“strings” $\\lambda_\\pm=\\lambda^{(1)} \\pm \\frac{i}{2}$ with real $\\lambda^{(1)}$ associated with the holon excitations and real solutions $\\lambda_j$ describing spin degrees of freedom. In the thermodynamic limit dressed energies $\\epsilon_c$ and $\\epsilon_s$ can be associated with the excitations of these objects. They are given in terms of coupled integral equations which are identical to those found for the chain without impurities [@schl:87]. In the resulting ground state energy the impurity contribution can be identified from its $L$-dependence which allows to compute the occupation, magnetization and susceptibilities of the impurity site. Analytical results for these expectation values are available only in limiting cases close to half filling and for densities near or below the critical density $n_c$ related to the magnetic field by $H=4\\sin^2(\\pi n_c/2)$ where the ground state is ferromagnetic and only real $\\lambda_j$ are present [@bef:up]. For general values of band filling and magnetic field the magnetization and particle number on the impurity site can be determined by numerically solving a set of two coupled integral equations (see Fig. \\[fig:gs\\_prop\\]): For $\\alpha\\to0$ the impurity mimics the bulk behaviour as discussed above. For large $\\alpha$ the impurity occupation number is close to 1 (2) for $n_e<n_c$ ($>n_c$) leading to an enhanced (reduced) magnetization at small (large) electron densities. The magnetic susceptibility of the impurity near half filling is found to be $\\sim \\chi_{bulk}/\\alpha$. We note that the magnetization curves for sufficiently large $\\alpha$ intersect the ones for small $\\alpha$.\n\nIn addition to the ground state properties the Bethe Ansatz allows to study the finite temperature behaviour of the system. The thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations for the system with impurity are the same as in the pure case [@schl:87]. Again the impurity contribution can be isolated in the free energy which can evaluated explicitly in the limit $T\\to\\infty$ and for $H\\gg T$ using Takahashi’s method [@taka:74]. In the high temperature limit we find $$\\begin{aligned}\n  F_{\\rm bulk}&=&-LT \\ln\\left(1+e^{\\frac{\\mu}{T}}2\\cosh\\frac{H}{2T}\\right)\n\\nonumber\\\\\nF_{\\rm imp}&=& -\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\alpha+2}-T\n\\ln\\left(1+e^{\\frac{2\\mu}{T}}+2e^{\\frac{\\mu}{T}}\\cosh\\frac{H}{2T}\\right)\n\\nonumber\\end{aligned}$$ giving the correct entropy in this limit. Note that the parameter $\\alpha$ enters the leading term in this expansion in a trivial way only.\n\nFor low temperatures $T\\ll H$ we can determine the phase diagram of the system. Most interesting is the behaviour at half filling where the impurity contribution to the specific heat is found to show a different temperature dependence than the one from the bulk: for $2\\mu>H>4$ the system is ferromagnetic and the low T free energy is given by (we suppress the contribution from the ground state energy) $$F_{\\rm bulk} \\approx -{L \\over 2 \\sqrt{\\pi}}T^{3/2} e^{4-H \\over T}, \\qquad\nF_{\\rm imp}\\approx  -{T} e^{H/2-\\mu \\over T}\\ .$$ For smaller magnetic fields the thermodynamic equilibrium state is not ferromagnetically ordered, the bulk free energy is $F_{\\rm bulk}\n\\approx-\\pi L T^2/(6v_s)$ with the spinon velocity $v_s$ and the impurity contribution is $F_{\\rm imp}\\approx -{2 \\over \\alpha}T^{3/2}$ up to factors that cannot be caculated in closed form in general. Near $H=H_c$ this factor becomes $\\sqrt{3 \\over 8}(4-H)^{-{3 \\over 4}} \\exp\\left({1\\over\nT}(H/2-\\mu+{2\\over 3 \\pi} (4-H)^{3/2})\\right)$.\n\nThe effect of the impurities on the transport properties of the system can be studied by calculating the spin- and charge stiffnesses from the finite size corrections to the ground state energy of the model subject to twisted boundary conditions [@Twist]. Following the analysis in [@bcfh:92] we introduce twist angles $\\phi_c$ and $\\phi_s$ affecting charge and spin degrees of freedom, respectively. The leading term in the resulting shift of the ground state energy can then be written as $\\Delta\nE(\\phi_c,\\phi_s)=L^{-1} \\phi_\\alpha D_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\alpha) \\phi_\\beta$ where charge (spin) stiffness are defined as $D^{(\\rho)}=(L/2)\\partial^2_\\phi \\Delta E(\\phi,0)=D_{cc}$ ($D^{(\\sigma)}=(L/2)\\partial^2_\\phi \\Delta E(\\phi,-2\\phi)$). The analysis of the finite-size corrections to the ground state energy yields the result that for the case of a single impurity the stiffnesses are not modified to leading order in $L^{-1}$. Hence, in spite of the presence of the impurity we find an infinite dc-conductivity. This is completely different from the situation in the “weak-link” type potential impurity discussed in [@kafi:92; @tsve:95a]: such a weak link drives the Luttinger liquid to a strong coupling fixed point characterized by a vanishing conductivity. We believe that the behaviour of the system considered here is related to its integrability and the absence of backscattering at the impurity.\n\nThe transport properties of the system do change if one considers a finite density $n_i$ of impurity sites. In this situation the band filling can take values larger than 1 as the impurity sites allow for double occupancies. Comparing the charge stiffness to that of the pure $t$–$J$ case one observes a reduction for densities just above the critical one. For larger band fillings the presence of the impurities leads to an enhancement of the stiffness (see Fig. \\[fig:stiff\\]). This is easily understood: $D^{(\\rho)}$ vanishes at half filling in the $t$–$J$ chain. The impurities do allow double occupancies thereby enlarging the phase space for the electrons which leads to an increase in the stiffness. At large fillings the stiffness increases as a function of $\\alpha$ as the average occupation number of the impurity sites are close to doubly occupied which makes the movement of electrons between the $t$–$J$ sites easier. In particular, the “absorption” of particles by the impurity sites for $\\alpha=\\infty$ leads to plateaus in the stiffness for $n_e<n_i$ (where it vanishes) and for $n_i+(1-n_i)n_c<n_e<2n_i+(1-n_i)n_c$. For other fillings the stiffness is simply given by that of the $t$–$J$ model (up to a rescaling). Similarly the reduction of the spin stiffness due to the addition of impurities can be understood.\n\nFinally, to study the effects of the impurity on the excitations in the model we have computed the phase shifts acquired by holons and spinons due to scattering off the impurity in the case of a microscopic number of holes in the half filled ground state at vanishing magnetic field. The basic ingredient for this calculation is the quantization condition for factorized scattering of two particles with rapidities $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ on a ring of length $N$, namely $\\exp(iNk(\\lambda_1))\nS(\\lambda_1-\\lambda_2) \\exp(\\psi(\\lambda_1))=1$ where $k(\\lambda)$ is the physical momentum in the infinite periodic system, $S(\\lambda)$ is the bulk scattering matrix for scattering of particles 1 and 2 and $\\psi(\\lambda_1)$ is the phase shift acquired when scattering off the impurity (note that this incorporates the fact that there is no backscattering at the impurity). Using the known result for $S$ [@babo:91] one extracts the impurity phase shifts using the method of [@kore:79; @al]: both the spinon and holon impurity phase shifts are proportional to $\\exp(-ik)$, where $k$ denotes the physical momentum of spinons/holons in the $t$-$J$ model [*without impurity*]{}. This reflects the fact that the impurity essentially decouples from the chain at half filling leading to a chain of $N-1$ sites. In addition the holons pick up a phase shift $(2i\\lambda-\\alpha)/(2i\\lambda+i\\alpha)$ due to the fact that the impurity site is charged. The pole at $\\lambda=i\\alpha/2$ corresponds to an impurity bound state for $\\alpha<2$.\n\nTo summarize, we have studied the effects of the addition of integrable impurities to the supersymmetric $t$–$J$ model on certain zero and finite temperature properties of the system. The properties of the impurity, which couples to both spin and charge degrees of freedom, can be tuned by adjusting a continous parameter $\\alpha$. Compared to the “weak-link” type impurities investigated by Kane and Fisher [@kafi:92] it appears to be very special in that its dc-conductivity is unchanged by the addition of a single impurity. We have argued that this is due to the absence of backscattering terms on the level of the dressed excitations (holons and spinons). Although the verification by explicit construction of the continuum limit for this system appears difficult one may speculate that similar to the case of a Kondo impurity in a Luttinger liquid [@FrojdhJ] a backscattering term would drive the system to a new fixed point. Hence the present model can be interpreted as an unstable fixed point from a renormalization group point of view.\n\nThis work has been supported in parts by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under Grant No. Fr 737/2–2.\n\n[10]{}\n\nC. L.

Since I am not doing it in my actual journal, I thought I would give this a try.\nCome learn a little about my inner workings (please, not too much though), some about Wifey, my lovely and talented wife, and Munchkin and Munchkenna, our incredibly darling girls. Besides talking about my family, you will probably hear some random information on books, music, art, and writing.\n\nSunday, April 8, 2012\n\nEaster Sunday\n\nToday was an Easter I wouldn't mind repeating. It was filled with lots of family and music, so what more could you ask for?\n\nI got asked on Saturday to play the organ for our church service today. I enjoy doing that, and wouldn't mind doing it more so I could get better on the organ. I still don't know much about stops, but if I had to play more often, I would be forced to learn. Anyway, the only let down about the service was that we didn't sing my favorite Easter hymn, O Savior, Thou Who Wearest a Crown.\nAfter the meeting, I had an elderly woman come up to me from the congregation and paid me a very nice compliment. She said that every time I get near an instrument, it thrills her. Although I flubbed a few notes, I guess I did something right on that old organ.\n\nI also loaned my copy of The Great Divorce by C. S. Lewis to someone who is struggling with the passing of his father. I read this novella a few years ago, and found it most instructional on what the afterlife might be like. If you are so inclined, I highly recommend it. I'll be eager to talk with him about if he found it helpful in his current situation.\n\nWe got the girls down for naps, even though Munchkenna didn't stay there very long. I watered all our non-flowering tulips and daffodils in hopes that they will flower this spring. Our hyacinths flowered great, but only one daffodil flowered, I'm guessing because we didn't plant them until early last year, and I think they are still trying to root into the earth before flourishing. Maybe next year.\n\nAfter a ham dinner with the in-laws, the kids hunted Easter eggs. They had so much fun that we sent them back inside and hid them again. The sun was shining, and it was about 70 degrees. Perfect weather to bask slightly out of the sun on the deck.\n\nWe went to an Easter concert tonight where one of Munchkin's aunt was singing a solo. Munchkin sat entranced on my lap as her aunt did a great rendition of Tell Me The Story. After it was done, Munchkin had to be escorted out of the chapel to use the restroom. Along the way, she kept singing part of the lyrics back to me. I had her go sing it for her aunt after the concert, and I think they were both equally pleased.\nAnd I also forgot to mention that I got to play prelude music for the concert. More creating for me! Hooray!\n\nAll in all, an above average day. I might even go so far as to say a great day. Now, tell me how your Easter was."

HRW says it appears the civilians were killed on the first day of the operation.\n\nThe report says the high civilian death toll and the nature of the recorded wounds \"indicate that opposition forces either intentionally or indiscriminately killed most of the remaining victims.\"\n\n\"The evidence strongly suggests that the killings, hostage taking, and other abuses committed by opposition forces on and after August 4 rise to the level of crimes against humanity,\" the report said.\n\nHRW says Islamist rebel groups - which include foreign fighters - are financed by individuals in Kuwait and other Gulf states. It calls on the UN to impose an arms embargo on all groups credibly accused of war crimes.\n\nHuman rights organizations also accuse Syrian government forces of killing civilians during the country's 31-month long conflict, most recently in a poison gas attack near Damascus on August 21 in which hundreds died. President Bashar al-Assad denied the allegations saying it was rebel fighters who were responsible.\n\nIn a separate case of war crimes during the fighting in Syria, a group of Hezbollah fighters filmed themselves rejoicing and celebrating as they dragged injured Syrian civilians from a van and executed them.\n\nHezbollah has been fighting alongside Syrian army forces loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad, and have provided key support in a number of strategically important operations against rebel forces."

        "text": "As people’s love for marijuana continues to grow day by day, so too does the cannabis industry. Marijuana enthusiasts thrive in an environment that allows them to deal with their weed. Now, it may seem difficult to find a career that can take advantage of your love for marijuana. Many people would think that looking for a job to fit the lifestyle of a marijuana lover is near impossible. But that is not the case.\n\nMany marijuana jobs out there can help marijuana enthusiasts realize their full potential without having to sacrifice their love for weed.\n\nThere have been many types of research about the different jobs that marijuana lovers could apply for. These are the types of jobs that don’t get you worrying about smoking an occasional joint or two. Who said you needed a corporate job to fulfill your wants and needs? What you need is a job that will develop your professional growth and bring out the potential in you.\n\nThe Marijuana Industry is already a progressing business. Both the sale and development of different types of marijuana have seen a steady increase throughout the years. This presents a growing number of opportunities for businessmen inclined in the sales and development of marijuana. Some may even say that marijuana is going to be the next big thing in years to come. Your weeds interests may lean more on growing, research, development or smoking. Regardless, there is sure to be a fit for you in finding marijuana-related jobs.\n\nFACTORS TO CONSIDER IN APPLYING FOR MARIJUANA JOBS\n\nWell, the most important factor is knowledge about the cannabis plant. Marijuana is a complex topic for those who are unfamiliar with it. In order to really flourish in the cannabis industry, you must know the different details about the plant. Knowing even the smallest details could help you land a job related to marijuana. Secondly, applying for a marijuana job requires dedication. It may seem intimidating for some because of the stigma surrounding marijuana. This is why marijuana jobs work best for marijuana enthusiasts.\n\nHere are the 10 Perfect Jobs for Marijuana Lovers:\n\nEDIBLE MAKER\n\nEdibles are one such way, being one of the most common types of weed usage. Edibles are food products that have weed mixed in them. Pastries, tea, coffee, chocolates, and even kinds of pasta are some of the most common types of edibles. It is easier to consume edibles, too. It lessens the number of people who smoke to get high, either for medical or recreational use.\n\nIf you are looking for a marijuana-related job, then being an edible maker is a great choice. Edible makers are actually one of the top jobs for marijuana lovers. At the same time, these are guilt-free snacks. There are several positions in marijuana edible making such as chefs, tasters, and processors. It is a job that focuses more on the production and handling of food. Not a bad choice for a full-time job, eh?\n\nDELIVERY PERSON\n\nMany marijuana seed banks sell their weed through online transactions. They depend on shipping rather than pick-ups since they do not have actual stores in the area. Rather, they publish their weed seeds and products on their websites. Customers can access these websites online and make their purchases from there. This is where a delivery person comes in. A delivery person brings the packages of marijuana to its customers.\n\nDelivery persons encompass both air and sea carriers It may seem easy since all they need to do is transport the package but that is not entirely true. A delivery person must also be knowledgeable about the product in case the customer asks any questions. It is a great job for people who look to broaden their knowledge about the cannabis industry.\n\nBUDTENDER\n\nIf you wish to work at your local weed dispensary, then this job is perfect for you. Budtenders are basically the sales agents of the cannabis industry. Many times, customers would have lots of questions regarding the different strains of weed. They also usually ask for recommendations about which strain they should buy. For this job, knowledge is key. The more you know about weed, the better.\n\nHaving a lot of experience with smoking weed is also an advantage. Giving recommendations based on personal experience helps assure the customers of your credibility as a budtender. This job is all about interacting with the customers. It would help to develop a friendly and approachable attitude if you wish to apply for this job. You could even make some new friends along the way.\n\nCASHIERS\n\nBeing a cashier in a weed dispensary requires much more than just counting cash. They are also expected to be well equipped with knowledge about the weed products being sold in the shop. They are also front-liners and customers may tend to ask them questions and inquiries as well. The more you are familiar with the products you offer, the higher the sales rate it will provide. It may sound like an entry-level position but it is a start. Cashiers are more like receptionists who should have a pleasing personality and the attitude of willingness to help your customers.\n\nSTORE MANAGERS\n\nJust like every other job, running a weed shop requires a leader. In order for an online and actual store to operate, you need a person who is capable of managing and delegating responsibilities to the employees. Being a store manager means a lot of things depend on your decisions. You get to handle the overall sales of products. You must also be able to maintain a good relationship with your employees.\n\nPeople would often look to you for direction. A weed store manager should be able to cater to the needs of people. They should make sure that customers get the weed strain that they need. A manager must also be able to give any information that could help customers decide what type of weed suits them. In addition to this, you need to demonstrate great working ethics to your employees.\n\nPRODUCTION MANAGER\n\nSimilar to a store manager, this position requires a certain degree of knowledge about marijuana. People in this position plan and come up with ideas that could result in better operations of weed dispensaries. Choosing the right types of strains to offer also falls under this job. A production manager also seeks other opportunities to make the business boom better. They handle everything from processes, operations, and handling of workers. The production manager is responsible for laying out their action plans, sales targets, budgets, and other administrative functions.\n\nGROWERS\n\nBeing a marijuana grower comes with many benefits. If you enjoy cultivating cannabis plants as a hobby, then this job is perfect for you. Growing marijuana is done by many people outside of their careers. But it can very well be a way of producing income. People who are suitable for this position should be educated about how marijuana grows and works. Experience in sales and in marijuana cultivation is a big advantage in this area. It can be done for your own small business or for a large company that you apply for. Either way, being a marijuana grower is definitely a fruitful experience.\n\nCANNABIS LAWYER\n\nIt is no secret that the stigma of marijuana continues to this day. Even if it has been more accepted in society than it has ever been before, it is still a sensitive topic. Because of this, having a cannabis lawyer is not such a bad idea for weed business.\n\nA cannabis lawyer is someone who can explain the legality of business when it comes to marijuana. A marijuana lawyer should be knowledgeable about how the sales of marijuana work. They should also be aware of the regulations regarding the legality of marijuana. As a consultant, you should be able to know how you will be able to preserve what the marijuana industry stands for.\n\nEXTRACT LAB TECHNICIAN\n\nWhen you were a kid, have you ever dreamt of becoming a scientist? Well, you can turn that dream into a reality in the cannabis industry. This job means extracting the cannabinoid content of marijuana into oil or wax. The cannabinoids of a marijuana plant are known to contain many properties that are useful for health benefits. This position requires experience in extraction processing. Just like any other laboratory job, applying would require a degree that specializes in extraction.\n\nVAPORIZER RETAILER\n\nWith the rise of technology, there are a lot of means of smoking marijuana. One of which is through the use of a vaporizer or electronic cigarettes. Considering that its popularity has significantly increased through the years, the sales of vaporizers are necessary for a dispensary shop. Because of this, there have been vape shops that focus more on weed vaporizers. It would require familiarity in the industry of marijuana as well as the utilization of the vaporizer.\n\nWhat’re Your Thoughts About Marijuana Jobs?\n\nTherefore, legalizing marijuana deals with a big impact on the cannabis industry. Cannabis connoisseurs are not the only ones affected by it. Those who want to run a business involving marijuana are presented with many more opportunities. Marijuana jobs suit those people who really take an interest in weed. There are a lot of micro and macro businesses dedicated to marijuana. People who are educated and experienced in the utilization and cultivation of marijuana have the chance to apply for jobs in these businesses.\n\nThere are still many things to be studied on marijuana. Further research and development are still required on what marijuana can offer. There are also other fields that can make use of marijuana. You might want to consider applying for jobs inclined to the sales and utilization of marijuana.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "Attitudes of new mothers towards genetics and newborn screening.\nTo evaluate new mothers' opinions of genetics and newborn screening. An Australian tertiary referral hospital. 232 women who delivered a liveborn infant and had received written and verbal information on newborn screening from midwifery staff during their antenatal care. Participants were interviewed within 24 hours of blood being taken from their baby by heel prick for the newborn screen. Non-English speaking women were included using medical interpreters. The questionnaire evaluated opinions about newborn screening and parental consent. The opportunity was used to also question their views on the impact on lifestyle and discrimination of a theoretical diagnosis of genetic disease or carrier status in their baby. Descriptive data on mother's attitudes. 200 women consented to participate in the study (86.2% response). New mothers supported newborn screening programs where outcomes could be used to prevent or reduce the severity of a disease (85-86% support), but were less supportive if screening had been used to assist with future family planning (65%). The majority of women (86%) felt that parental consent was mandatory before newborn screening tests were performed. A similar number felt that consent would be required before blood samples could be used if a National DNA library were to be created. The majority of women expressed concern that a child with a genetic illness would face discrimination and difficulty obtaining insurance or employment. A third of women felt that even a carrier of a genetic illness would face similar discrimination. Acceptance of newborn screening programs is high but mothers consider the need for consent to be mandatory. They have concerns about discrimination children with genetic illnesses may face."

        "text": "INTRODUCTION {#sec1-1}\n============\n\nSurgical care of bladder exstrophy starts immediately after birth and includes various staged procedures as well as one stage repair. Essentially with any procedure, the aim is to close the opened out bladder to make it a reservoir for urine storage and provide sufficient muscular outlet resistance to provide a voluntary continence mechanism. Occasionally, some bladders cannot be closed primarily due to small sized bladder template or repeated failed closures or occasionally due to late presentation. These bladders are thick and fibrosed with superimposed cystitis cystica making primary closure difficult and occasionally impossible. Under normal circumstances, it has been shown that such bladders grow in size with time and majority undergo a delayed primary closure, which usually succeeds.\\[[@ref1]\\] The disadvantage of this technique is that the bladder may grow, but inflammation and fibrosis continues unabated and leaking open bladder during waiting period is challenging to parents. An ileal patch has been used as a temporary cover over small bladders in five patients and the results are encouraging. At the end of 4 months, the bladder could be closed after excising the bowel in four patients. These were the patients in whom repeated attempts at bladder closure had failed and further attempts at closure by routine were not possible.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS {#sec1-2}\n=====================\n\nForty-five children with exstrophy bladder were treated by two staged radical soft-tissue mobilization procedure over a period of 10 years from May 2001 to June 2010 in a tertiary care referral center. Five patients were included for temporary ileal patch cover who had repeated failures at primary bladder closure. In one patient, the bladder size was less than 3 cm at birth \\[[Figure 1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\] and dehisced twice after closure. The remaining four patients were late referrals from other hospitals after multiple failures at bladder closure, so the data on the initial bladder size was not available. There were three girls and two boys with a mean age at initial bladder closure being 14 months and 5 days (2 days to 36 months). In one patient, the bladder was closed on day 2 of life and the rest of the patients had delayed initial bladder closure. Two patients had undergone osteotomy during initial bladder closure (done elsewhere). The mean age at ileal patch was 22 months (8-48 months). Mean age at 2^nd^ stage was 28 months and 3 days. At the time of ileal patch closure, the average size of the bladder was less than 3 cm and could not be invaginated under general anesthesia \\[[Figure 2](#F2){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\]. All patients who presented with small bladders at birth before any attempt at primary closure were excluded.\n\n![Very small bladder plate in a neonate. This child had complete dehiscence after two attempts at primary closure. A temporary ileal patch was successful](JIAPS-19-222-g001){#F1}\n\n![Repeated attempts at bladder closure sometimes render them so small and fibrotic that primary closure is impossible. All the five patients in our series had such bladder, where primary closure was not possible](JIAPS-19-222-g002){#F2}\n\nTechnique of ileal patch {#sec2-1}\n------------------------\n\nConsent form was obtained for primary closure as well as application of patch before surgery. All children were operated under general anesthesia with caudal anesthetic block. Preoperatively standard preparation as for other bladder closures was used. Perioperative antibiotics were given and continued until the ureteral catheters was removed. No specific bowel preparation or prolonged fasting was used for the procedure. The ureters are intubated with 5Fr. Infant feeding tubes and anchored. After mobilizing the bladder from skin and rectus sheath, the peritoneum was deliberately opened just below the umbilicus \\[[Figure 3a](#F3){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\]. An appropriate sized ileal segment with intact mesentery away from the ileocecal junction is carefully isolated \\[[Figure 3b](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\], detubularized by opening near the mesenteric border, cleaned with Betadine solution and was anastomosed full thickness to the mobilized bladder \\[[Figure 3c](#F5){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\], the lower limit being just above the verumontanum. The lower end at the bladder neck was left open through which the ureteral catheters exited. Rectus muscle was closed in mid-line by mobilizing the medial margins of anterior rectus sheath. Skin closure was completed \\[[Figure 3d](#F6){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\].\n\n![Technique of ileal patch. Peritoneum is opened above bladder and terminal ileal loop is isolated](JIAPS-19-222-g003){#F3}\n\n![Window is made in mesentery to carefully preserve the vascular arcade](JIAPS-19-222-g004){#F4}\n\n![Detubularized ileal patch is sutured to mobilized bladder. Note: Ureteral catheters exiting at lower end](JIAPS-19-222-g005){#F5}\n\n![Completed abdominal closure](JIAPS-19-222-g006){#F6}\n\nPostoperatively the baby was nursed in trendelenburg position with immobilization of lower limbs, by strapping them together with pad and bandage for 48-72 h. This was to prevent tension on the mesentery. The baby was fasted until the bowel function returned. The ureteral catheters were removed after 5-7 days. The 2^nd^ stage was done after 4-6 months preceded by a cystoscopy. Before closure, all children were evaluated for renal function (Blood urea and serum creatinine, electrolyte disturbance, urine culture and renal tract ultrasound). In the 2^nd^ stage, the patch was excised along with margin of the bladder mucosa and bladder closure and sphincter repair was done as a single stage.\n\nRESULTS \\[[TABLE 1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}\\] {#sec1-3}\n============================================\n\n###### \n\nThe characteristics of patients undergone ileal patch\n\n![](JIAPS-19-222-g007)\n\nNone of the patients had major acid base or electrolyte disturbance and urine was sterile before the 2^nd^ stage. Ultrasound was normal in all patients before 2^nd^ stage. At the end of 4 months in four patients, cystoscopy showed that the bladder had grown in size, with virtual absence of cystitis cystica and the bowel patch had become a diverticulum. This patch was excised. Bladder closure with epispadias repair and sphincter/levator approximation could be done as a single procedure and was successful in all four patients. In one patient, the bladder remained the same at 4 months and repeats cystoscopy twice after 3 months and 6 months showed small bladder and was unsuitable for 2^nd^ stage repair. He was counseled for a second attempt of patch closure, but parents opted for a permanent augmentation.\n\nThe follow-up after completion of sphincter repair was similar to the follow-up being used for conventionally managed children with renal tract ultrasound every 6 months, micturating cystourethrogram if needed, and assessment of continence at regular intervals. Functional assessment for continence was done when child reached 5 years of age. There were no complications related to use of bowel in these patients. No significant fluid and electrolyte disturbance were seen in any patient during follow-up. Minor complications were seen in four patients. Superficial wound dehiscence occurred in two patients after 2^nd^ stage, which healed with conservative management. One boy had a penopubic fistula which needed repair and one girl had vulval scarring which was repaired.\n\nDISCUSSION {#sec1-4}\n==========\n\nAt birth, the exstrophic bladder is smooth, pliable, and most can be closed primarily, though the size of bladder template is variable. Small bladders eventually grow after closure.\\[[@ref2]\\] In a child with small bladder plate it can be closed primarily with the hope that it grows with age and the 2^nd^ stage can be done later. The other option is to delay the closure for 6 months to 1 year and studies have shown that the bladder grows in size making closure possible.\\[[@ref3]\\] In a series of 19 patients with a small bladder managed by delayed closure over 6 months, Dodson *et al*.\\[[@ref3]\\] have reported that in nine patients, functional repair was possible (47%) and achieved continence; delay in closure did not decrease the need for augmentation, but achievement of functional continence was unaffected. However, the same may not be possible in patients in multiple redo closures and failed closures. In such cases, primary closure of the bladder is impossible as multiple attempts at closure may occasionally render it fibrotic and thickened.\n\nAs our institute being a major referral center for exstrophy management, over the past 10 years we came across five such children with very small fibrotic bladders who had multiple failed closures. Sparing a permanent augmentation we innovated a way to close these bladders by applying a patch of ileum temporarily. After 4 months, the bladder had grown in size, became more pliable and cystitis cystica had resolved \\[[Figure 1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\]. In the 2^nd^ stage the bowel segment was excised, the bladder could be closed and the radical soft-tissue mobilization with sphincter repair and levatorplasty was completed. One patient showed no sign of bladder growth at 6 months after ileal patch.\n\nThe mechanism of ileal patch and bladder growth could be explained partly on the basis of changes seen in permanently augmented bladders. With an opened out bladder (as in unclosed exstrophy) there is no urine recycling and repeated inflammation due to exposure renders it fibrotic. With a patch, the urine recycling is maintained which is an impetus to bladder growth. Also with a closed bladder, inflammation and fibrosis is avoided. The bowel doesn't grow as much as bladder because of detubularization. It has been shown that ileal mucosal atrophy occurs due to prolonged exposure to urine\\[[@ref4][@ref5]\\] and the vascularity to ileum may reduce. The net effect is bladder grows, becomes pliable and the bowel becomes a diverticulum \\[[Figure 4](#F4){ref-type=\"fig\"}\\].\n\n![Principles of ileal patch closure. The thickened trabeculated small sized bladder has grown in size, folded on itself and at the end of 4 months, the ileal patch has become a diverticulum. Note the communication between the two segments has become a small fibrotic ring and this was consistently seen in four of the five patients who underwent patch closure](JIAPS-19-222-g008){#F7}\n\nIndividuals who have undergone augmentation cystoplasty and ileal conduit diversion are at increased risk for the late development of cancer with overall incidence of 1.5%. Adenocarcinomas develop at or near the enterourothelial junction.\\[[@ref6]\\] While excising the bowel before bladder closure, we have ensured that sufficient margin of enterourothelial junction is also excised. We do not have data on whether a short period of exposure of the bladder to ileum, risks malignancy. A temporary ileal patch is a major procedure and is only used as a desperate measure to salvage a scarred fibrotic exstrophy bladder. Presently we would not recommend its use in a neonate with small exstrophy bladder without any attempts at primary closure or delayed primary closure.\n\nCONCLUSION {#sec1-5}\n==========\n\nNative bladder is the best reservoir for urine storage. Small fibrotic bladder with repeated failures to achieve a primary closure should not be excised. A temporary bowel patch makes bladder closure possible by preventing further fibrosis and allowing bladder growth. Until further refinements in tissue engineering techniques of bladder regeneration are successful, a temporary bowel patch should be a viable option in managing such patients.\n\n**Source of Support:** Nil\n\n**Conflict of Interest:** None declared.\n"

        "text": "Drake said Siuslaw officials had notified his company promptly about the problems and that G-P expects an offer of replacement timber, “but that has not been identified yet.”\n\nLevi Beelart, the owner of B&G Logging, said his company is out nearly $100,000 in lost production after being pulled off the Porter Thin, a 5.5 million-board-foot timber sale near Florence. That left his crew of 16 equipment operators, riggers, truck drivers and supervisors idle until they could shift to another logging site.\n\n“At 11 o’clock one morning they came up to us and said we needed to stop all operations,” he said. “It took us four days to move to another job, so we lost four days.”\n\nBeelart said he’s been assured the Forest Service will cover his out-of-pocket expenses, but he’s nervous that finding replacement timber for the affected contracts could mean fewer logs available for companies like his a year or two down the road.\n\nStill, he said, the Siuslaw has been a good partner to work with and seems to be doing the best it can to rectify the problem.\n\n“I don’t think it was their fault, necessarily,” Beelart said. “No matter who you are, you’re going to make mistakes. It’s how you deal with them and move forward that matters.”"

The latter will also unpack and extract everything into a 'linux-3.19.1' directory.\nAt first I thought both versions would result with the same code, as they have the same kernel version and patch level (based on the report of the apt-cache command). However, diff command reported differences when comparing the unpacked source from apt-get install with the unpacked source from apt-get source (for both patched and non-patched code).\nWhen comparing apt-get install with apt-get source:\n$ diff -rq apt-get-install/ apt-get-source/ | wc -l\n253\n\n$ diff -rq apt-get-install/ apt-get-source/ | grep \"Only in\"\nOnly in apt-get-install/arch/arm/boot/dts: sun7i-a20-bananapro.dts\nOnly in apt-get-install/arch/s390/include/asm: cmb.h.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/dma-buf: reservation.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/dma-buf: seqno-fence.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/gpu/drm/i915: i915_irq.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/scsi: constants.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_acm.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_ecm.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_obex.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_serial.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_subset.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/include/linux: reservation.h.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/kernel: sys.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/lib: crc32.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/sound/soc: soc-cache.c.1\n\nAnd when comparing apt-get install with apt-get source (+ patch):\n$ diff -rq apt-get-install/ apt-get-source+patch/\nOnly in apt-get-install/arch/s390/include/asm: cmb.h.1\nOnly in apt-get-source+patch/: debian\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/dma-buf: reservation.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/dma-buf: seqno-fence.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/gpu/drm/i915: i915_irq.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/scsi: constants.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_acm.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_ecm.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_obex.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_serial.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/drivers/usb/gadget/function: f_subset.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/include/linux: reservation.h.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/kernel: sys.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-install/lib: crc32.c.1\nOnly in apt-get-source+patch/: .pc\nOnly in apt-get-install/sound/soc: soc-cache.c.1\n\nI've found some links where both methods are mentioned but I couldn't get anything clear from those:\nhttps://kernel-handbook.alioth.debian.org/ch-common-tasks.html#s-common-official\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile (Option B vs Alternate option B)\nI would really appreciate if someone could tell me the differences and advise me which is the preferred option. Thank you.\n\nA:\n\nIn Debian terminology, when you run\napt-get source linux-image-3.19.0-trunk-amd64\n\n(or the equivalent apt-get source linux), you're actually downloading and extracting the source package. This contains the upstream code (the kernel source code downloaded from kernel.org) and all the Debian packaging, including patches added to the kernel by the Debian kernel team.\nWhen you run\napt-get install linux-source-3.19\n\nyou're actualling installing a binary package which happens to contain the source code of the Linux kernel with the Debian patches applied and none of the Debian packaging infrastructure.\nThe source package's name is just linux; apt-get source will convert any binary package name it is given into the corresponding source package name.\nBy the way, since experimental packages aren't upgraded automatically, you should make sure you've updated your copy of linux-source-3.19 and re-extracted it before comparing; the .dts file you're seeing in your diff was introduced in the latest update. The packages currently in the archive all contain this file.\nThe remaining differences are pretty much normal: as has been indicated in the comments, debian contains all the packaging and is only in the source package, .pc is used by quilt to keep track of the original files modified by patches, and is also only in the source package, and the .1 files are generated manpages, probably a side-effect of the kernel build, and therefore only appear in the binary package (but they shouldn't really be there).\nThe reference package is the source package, as obtained by apt-get source. This builds all the kernel binary packages, including linux-source-3.19 which you install with apt-get install. The latter is provided as a convenience for other packages which may need the kernel source; it's guaranteed to be in the same place all the time, unlike the source package which is just downloaded in the current directory at the time apt-get source is run.\nAs far as documentation goes, I'd follow the Debian documentation in the kernel handbook (section 4.5). Rebuilding the full Debian kernel as documented in section 4.2 which you linked to takes a very long time because it builds a number of variants.\n\n"

        "text": "Breaking down the unorthodox Sparks for Clarkson trade\n\nIn July 2013, then-Leafs General Manager Dave Nonis said of the contract he gave his big signing, David Clarkson: “I’m not worried about years six and seven”. Nonis is gone, but as it turns out, the Leafs will be worrying – two times over, about year seven, as the team has acquired his contract while pulling in an asset for backup goaltender Garret Sparks.\n\nGiven the Leafs’ cap crunch, and that Mitch Marner remains unsigned, it might seem a little absurd that they would be taking back a $5.25 million contract – especially one that is considered by many to be the worst in franchise history, and a miracle to have escaped from (sort of) to begin with. But let’s touch on a few quick points, to settle the confusion.\n\nToronto’s Cursed LTIR Blessing\n\nFor those of you who didn’t click that “sort of”, here’s a quick refresher on how the Leafs got out of the Clarkson deal to begin with: In early 2015, the team, realizing just how bad of a mistake they had made with his contract, took advantage of a unique proposal given to them by the Blue Jackets.\n\nColumbus had signed Nathan Horton to a contract with very similar terms, except they didn’t insure his deal against injury. This meant that when Horton’s career ended due to a degenerative back issue, the lower-budget Blue Jackets were stuck paying over $5 million per year in cash to a player who couldn’t play, instead of the insurance company footing 80% of the bill. They felt that a struggling player at the same price was better than an unusable body. Toronto accepted the deal, shedding a roster spot and having the ability to put Horton on Long-Term Injured Reserve, should they need to.\n\nUp until now, things have unravelled in a pretty funny way. Toronto has never needed to activate Horton’s LTIR in-season, and Clarkson ended up with the same degenerative injury – meaning that they could’ve saved over $20 million in real dollars by waiting a few more months for Clarkson’s nagging pains to get the best of him. This season was expected to be the first that Toronto would have to use Horton’s injury to get under the cap, and now they have both.\n\nTo give a simplified explanation on how LTIR works – it’s not as simple as a floating $0 cap hit on the player. In essence, you’re using your injured players to buy down cap space at the time that they’re placed on it.\n\nToronto was sitting at roughly $70.5 million in committed roster salaries without Marner signed, meaning that he would have to sign for under $7 million to avoid LTIR being used going into opening night. So, knowing that the team was going to be there anyway, Toronto was in a unique position to take on another LTIR cap dump in exchange for an asset.\n\nThe Leafs also have a slight, unlikely to be used benefit in having that second injured player on the cap. Should Marner’s negotiations bleed into the season, having Clarkson on the roster will allow them to build a bigger buffer to slot him in later. Toronto would essentially build a barebones opening day roster that includes Clarkson and Horton as a part of it to get as close to the ceiling as possible, place both of them on LTIR to get that buy-back, and then repopulate the team with more room to sign Marner than if they just did this with Horton.\n\nVegas, on the other hand, were in a position where the team would have been able to exceed the cap with Clarkson’s LTIR, but shedding his contract would be enough to get them under it cleanly with a full roster (Nikita Gusev notwithstanding). This wasn’t quite a situation where the Golden Knights were desperate to get rid of that deal, but doing so gave them a little bit of a boost – hence the sweetener not being as massive as we’ve seen in some other cap dump deals. Vegas are effectively shedding $1 million in cap space while Toronto is gaining $0 – it’s hardly a case of $5.3 in, $5.3 out.\n\nA Potentially Forced Hand\n\nSo this brings us to the meat of this trade that the ability to take on Clarkson, his $5.2 million in cap hit, and ~$1 million in real dollars facilitated, with the team sending Garret Sparks to Vegas in exchange for a fourth-round pick.\n\nFrom a pure value perspective, it seems about right; non-starting goaltenders rarely get moved for more than a mid-late round pick, and Sparks, as many Leafs fans will tell you, did not live up to his historic 2017/18 AHL season with his performance as the big club’s backup last year.\n\nIn 20 games last year, the 26-year-old netminder posted an 8-9-1 record, attached to a 0.902 save percentage and 3.15 goals against average. The process to get there was complicated, too – a bloodbath of a debate about who should get the backup job in the preseason, two other goaltenders lost to waivers to make it happen, a concussion, and some unfortunate appearances started the proverbial fire, which was further stoked by Sparks calling out his team’s need to show more emotion on the ice, a lack of delivery on his own end, and what looked a lot like an exiling at the end of the season so he could “work on his game”.\n\nI’d imagine that his outspokenness led to that exile more than his play, because while his play wasn’t fantastic, it wasn’t terrible for a first-full-year goaltender, particularly with league-wide save percentages dipping.\n\nOnce you pull apart the numbers, it wasn’t a terrible year. For $750,000, Sparks posted an average regular and 5-on-5 save percentage for a backup, an average PK save percentage compared to the whole league, and a top-third high-danger save percentage – oddly, only really bombing on low danger shots that you’d expect most goalies to have. It certainly wasn’t bad enough to feel strong emotions about one way or another, and didn’t cost them anything in the standings.\n\nBut we know that Mike Babcock’s lack of patience with attitudes that don’t mesh with his is low, and his lenience with backup goaltenders is even lower – the combination of Sparks’ outspokenness and statistical mediocrity likely dug his proverbial grave. To add some urgency to the management side, the team was able to retain 2018/19 Marlies starter Michael Hutchinson at an even lower NHL cap hit than Sparks’ ($700,000 – even $50,000 matters this year!), and have also signed Michal Neuvirth to a PTO as a fallback.\n\nRealistically, I’d imagine this was a case of Babcock not wanting Sparks back, and management not seeing much value in fighting that specific war, given that it’s a pretty low-leverage roster spot.\n\nSo Is This Good?\n\nHonestly, it’s hard to say.\n\nI know I’m happy for Sparks specifically, in the sense that he gets to fight Malcolm Subban for the backup role in training camp, and if it doesn’t work out, his one-way contract and non-impressive stats in the show next year might be enough to get him to clear waivers – which would put him close to his hometown with the Chicago Wolves.\n\nI can’t help but feel like the Leafs don’t particularly get better here. Sparks has been an easy whipping boy, but he’s still the youngest of their viable options, and still had promising aspects to his game – I can’t help but feel that he’s still got a shot in the NHL, and it would have been nice to see him do it here. I don’t think a fourth-round pick really moves the needle compared to the potential upside of him rebounding.\n\nWith that said, the pressures of the cap, the scrutiny of the public, and the skepticism of the coach made this a likely avenue, so it’s about as sensible of a move as any. Taking advantage of that Clarkson contract for a second, convoluted way is admittedly pretty hilarious and it’s a shrewd way to use unclaimable cap space. The insurance if Marner spills into the season helps too.\n\nIt’s one of those moves that feels practically smart, but not quite right all the same. Odds are, though, that it’ll have little consequence on the grand scheme of things, so perhaps the best plan is to enjoy the absurdity for what it is.\n\nLiked it?

        "text": "More on Covid-19\n\nNEW DELHI: As 'what's next?' was the agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's fourth video conference with Chief Ministers, he asked them to come back with a detailed plan on how they seek to ease the lockdown, said sources on Monday. The source, however added, no final decision was taken about either the extension or the relaxation in the same. The second leg of the lockdown ends on May 3.While most Chief Ministers advocated for the extension of the lockdown, a significant number of states raised their economic concerns with the Prime Minister. There were nine Chief Ministers who spoke on Monday. Out of the nine, at least four advocated for an extension of the lockdown. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik is believed to have asked for the lockdown to be extended for another month.However, most states wanted greater economic activities to be allowed that may address the twin concerns of job losses and revenue shortfall. Already states like Punjab have written to the Centre asking it to allow the sale of liquor due to the massive revenue shortfalls.Unlike the third meeting, there has been a nuanced demand from many states as far as extension of the lockdown is concerned rather than a blanket extension. For instance, Meghalaya demanded the lockdown to continue while activities be allowed in green zones. Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma said, \"We have mooted to continue with the lockdown post May 3rd with relaxation on activities in Green Zones or non-Covid affected districts in Meghalaya\".The Prime Minister is believed to have told the Chief Ministers in Monday's meeting that the target should be to turn red zones into orange and orange zones into green. Sources say, he was not closed to the idea of allowing the limited activity, but wanted states to come up with a fine print on how they seek to do that while ensuring the \"do gaz doori\" principle was adhered to.Modi said that India as a whole and states will have to give importance to the economy while continuing the fight against COVID-19. He suggested that both are equally important. \"We have to be brave and bring in reforms that touch the lives of common citizens,\" he told the Chief Ministers.However, he warned that the danger of COVID-19 is far from over and vigilance, particularly in the coming days and months will prove crucial on how India will fare in dealing with the outbreak. He added that the importance for states to enforce guidelines strictly in the hotspots or the red zone areas is a must. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that the need to enforce lockdown is crucial so that maximum lives are saved.Meanwhile, on the issue of getting back the Indians who are overseas, he said that this has to be done keeping in mind the fact that they don't get inconvenienced and their families are not under any risk.Government sources indicate, any decision on 'What's Next', is unlikely to come before the states get back with their fine print on how they want to give area specific relaxations. In other words, the Prime Minister has not just made the Chief Ministers give their suggestions and voice concerns, but also let them tell the tell the Centre on how they want to do it."

        "text": "1. Introduction {#sec1-ijms-20-03660}\n===============\n\nThe International Energy Agency defines a biorefinery as \"the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable products and energy\", which is the most comprehensive and commonly accepted definition \\[[@B1-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Because inexpensive petroleum-derived chemicals are already mass produced, the production of bio-based chemicals has been limited to those with structures that are too complex for the fine-chemicals market to justify their expensive production costs \\[[@B2-ijms-20-03660]\\]. However, nonrenewable resources are limited despite population growth. Accordingly, the increased consumer demand for environmentally friendly products has become a driving force for the use of biorefineries \\[[@B2-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Emerging economies (e.g., the countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC)) require increasing amounts of oil and other fossil-based products, in addition to the security of chemical and energy supplies for isolated regions such as islands \\[[@B2-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Carboxylic acids have attracted considerable attention among the raw materials for bioderived chemicals. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has selected twelve chemicals from more than three hundred biomass-derived chemicals, based on cooperative research with industry and academia, to be developed using biorefinery production methods \\[[@B3-ijms-20-03660]\\]. More than half of the twelve selected chemicals are carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids obtained by the oxidation of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides are referred to as sugar acids \\[[@B4-ijms-20-03660],[@B5-ijms-20-03660],[@B6-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The oxidation of aldose (aldohexose when the carbon number is six) at its aldehyde group to form a carboxyl group produces aldonic acid (aldohexonic acid), whereas the corresponding oxidation at its terminal hydroxy group results in a different monocarboxylic acid, (aldo)uronic acid ((aldo)hexuronic acid). Aldaric acid (hexaric acid) is a dicarboxylic acid produced by oxidizing both groups ([Figure 1](#ijms-20-03660-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Because aldaric acids have been studied for numerous types of applications, improved methods for their production are urgently needed. [d]{.smallcaps}-Glucaric acid, the aldaric acid of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucose or [l]{.smallcaps}-gulose, was selected by the DOE as one of the twelve chemicals \\[[@B3-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Hence, this article summarizes biorefinery methods relating to aldaric acids with six carbon atoms (hexaric acids; [Figure 1](#ijms-20-03660-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}), including [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid.\n\n2. Classification of Aldohexoses and Hexaric Acids {#sec2-ijms-20-03660}\n==================================================\n\nAldohexoses have four stereocenters, resulting in sixteen configurational isomers ([Figure 1](#ijms-20-03660-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Relative-configuration classification divides these stereoisomers into eight groups with the following common names: altrose, allose, idose, galactose, glucose, gulose, talose, and mannose. In contrast, hexaric acids have the same functional group at both ends of their structure; thus, the hexaric acids of altrose and talose and those of glucose and gulose are the same compounds. Moreover, the hexaric acids of allose and galactose are *meso*-compounds, because of their symmetry. In short, relative-configuration classification divides hexaric acids into altraric acid, allaric acid, idaric acid, galactaric acid, glucaric acid, and mannaric acid; because allaric acid and galactaric acid are *meso*-compounds, the total number of configurational isomers is ten ([Figure 2](#ijms-20-03660-f002){ref-type=\"fig\"}) \\[[@B7-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Because hexaric acids have four stereochemically diverse secondary hydroxy groups and two carboxyl groups, their applications as platform chemicals have been studied as described below. Of the hexaric acids, [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric, *meso*-galactaric, and [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acids have been the most studied as starting compounds for biorefineries, in part because the raw materials for these hexaric acids are abundant. Therefore, several compounds, such as [l]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acid \\[[@B8-ijms-20-03660],[@B9-ijms-20-03660]\\] and [d]{.smallcaps}-idaric acid, \\[[@B10-ijms-20-03660],[@B11-ijms-20-03660]\\] which are used as the starting compounds for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors, are regarded as exceptions in this report. The focus of this article is on studies investigating the applications and production methods for [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid, *meso*-galactaric acid, and [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acid.\n\n3. Applications of Hexaric Acids {#sec3-ijms-20-03660}\n================================\n\nBecause hexaric acids have four stereochemically diverse secondary hydroxy groups and two carboxyl groups, they have been studied since the 1950s as platform chemicals for producing chelating agents and corrosion inhibitors \\[[@B10-ijms-20-03660],[@B11-ijms-20-03660],[@B12-ijms-20-03660],[@B13-ijms-20-03660],[@B14-ijms-20-03660],[@B15-ijms-20-03660],[@B16-ijms-20-03660],[@B17-ijms-20-03660],[@B18-ijms-20-03660],[@B19-ijms-20-03660],[@B20-ijms-20-03660],[@B21-ijms-20-03660]\\], precursors for polyamides \\[[@B22-ijms-20-03660],[@B23-ijms-20-03660],[@B24-ijms-20-03660],[@B25-ijms-20-03660],[@B26-ijms-20-03660],[@B27-ijms-20-03660],[@B28-ijms-20-03660],[@B29-ijms-20-03660],[@B30-ijms-20-03660],[@B31-ijms-20-03660],[@B32-ijms-20-03660],[@B33-ijms-20-03660],[@B34-ijms-20-03660],[@B35-ijms-20-03660],[@B36-ijms-20-03660]\\], polyesters \\[[@B37-ijms-20-03660],[@B38-ijms-20-03660],[@B39-ijms-20-03660],[@B40-ijms-20-03660],[@B41-ijms-20-03660]\\], polyanhydrides \\[[@B42-ijms-20-03660]\\], polycations \\[[@B43-ijms-20-03660]\\], coordination polymers including metal--organic frameworks \\[[@B44-ijms-20-03660],[@B45-ijms-20-03660],[@B46-ijms-20-03660],[@B47-ijms-20-03660],[@B48-ijms-20-03660]\\], pendant polymers \\[[@B49-ijms-20-03660]\\], macromolecules \\[[@B50-ijms-20-03660],[@B51-ijms-20-03660]\\], cross-linkers in hydrogels \\[[@B52-ijms-20-03660]\\], medicines \\[[@B8-ijms-20-03660],[@B9-ijms-20-03660],[@B10-ijms-20-03660],[@B11-ijms-20-03660],[@B49-ijms-20-03660],[@B51-ijms-20-03660],[@B53-ijms-20-03660]\\], and other compounds including platform chemicals, like adipic acid and furan dicarboxylic acid \\[[@B54-ijms-20-03660],[@B55-ijms-20-03660],[@B56-ijms-20-03660],[@B57-ijms-20-03660],[@B58-ijms-20-03660],[@B59-ijms-20-03660],[@B60-ijms-20-03660],[@B61-ijms-20-03660],[@B62-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\n3.1. Monomers {#sec3dot1-ijms-20-03660}\n-------------\n\nThe use of hexaric acids as monomers produces polycondensates that are nontoxic, biodegradable, and more hydrophilic than those derived from petrochemicals \\[[@B36-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Research on polyamide syntheses derived from hexaric acids started in the 1950s \\[[@B22-ijms-20-03660]\\] and continues, particularly in the laboratory of Kiely. This group has synthesized polyamides from three monomers, [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid, *meso*-galactaric acid, and [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acid, to investigate the influence of stereochemistry on the physical properties of polymers \\[[@B31-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The polyamides were synthesized in methanol from either a hexaric acid diester or a methylated hexaric acid lactone, which were synthesized by a condensation reaction of a hexaric acid and methanol, with even-number-chain-length alkylenediamines having two to twelve carbon atoms as the monomers ([Figure 3](#ijms-20-03660-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}A--C).\n\nA comparison between poly(alkylene galactaramide)s synthesized from *meso*-galactaric acid and poly(alkylene [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaramide)s from [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid revealed that the melting points of poly(alkylene galactaramide)s were all higher than those of poly(alkylene [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaramide)s when the length of the alkylenediamine used was the same. Furthermore, it was found that, while the poly(alkylene [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaramide)s composed of alkylenediamines with two and four carbon atoms were water soluble, only the poly(alkylene galactaramide) produced from ethylenediamine was water soluble ([Table 1](#ijms-20-03660-t001){ref-type=\"table\"}). *meso*-Galactaric acid has a highly symmetric structure in which the carbon chain extends in a zigzag, bearing alternating hydroxy groups as confirmed by crystallography \\[[@B63-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Through these hydroxy groups, *meso*-galactaric acids can interact via intermolecular hydrogen bonding \\[[@B63-ijms-20-03660]\\]. In the case of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid, which is asymmetric, the 1,3-steric repulsions between the hydroxy groups at the C2 and C4 positions result in a bent molecular structure rather than an extended-zigzag structure \\[[@B64-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Kiely et al. reported that the stereochemical differences between hexaric acids were responsible for the differences in the physical properties between the polyamides \\[[@B31-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Because the galactaric acid moiety is extended, poly(alkylene galactaramide)s readily become linear. The adoption of a linear structure could increase both the hydrogen bonding between the galactaric acid moieties and the van der Waals forces derived from alignment of the alkylenediamine moieties. In contrast, poly(alkylene [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaramide)s tend to form a bent structure because the [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid moiety is bent, preventing attractive forces from developing between the polymers. The authors concluded that the differences in interchain attraction underlay the differences in melting points and water solubility between these compounds. Poly(alkylene [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaramide)s have head-to-tail type stereoregularity because of the hydroxy groups bound symmetrically along the carbon chain of [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acid moiety. Because the 1,3-steric repulsions are not present in [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acid, the authors assumed that the acid tends to form extended-zigzag structures, resulting in melting points and water solubility similar to those of poly(alkylene galactaramide)s. Polymer syntheses that take advantage of physical property differences derived from the different stereochemical properties of aldaric acids have been reported. For example, a polymer derived from [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid has an amorphous nature because the attractive interactions between the polymers are weak, which is advantageous for synthesizing materials that have good film-forming and adhesive properties \\[[@B30-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The nature of *meso*-galactaric acid-derived polymers, which tend to form linear structures, was used to improve the thermophysical properties of polyanhydrides \\[[@B42-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Henkensmeier et al. reported that they were able to change the physical properties of a polymer by combining [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid and *meso*-galactaric acid; their method allowed for precisely adjusting the glass transition temperatures of silicone surfactants \\[[@B34-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\n3.2. Application of Hexaric Acid Polymers: An Example {#sec3dot2-ijms-20-03660}\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nApplications of synthetic polymers, including as drug delivery carriers, have been reported. Liu and Reineke et al. reported polyamides composed of hexaric acid moieties and secondary amines as the repeating units that could replace viruses as nucleic acid medicine carriers ([Figure 3](#ijms-20-03660-f003){ref-type=\"fig\"}E--G) \\[[@B35-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Conventionally, polyethylene imines (PEIs) and chitosan have been studied as substitutes for viruses. The PEIs used in this study showed high gene-transport efficiencies in almost all cell lines used in the study, and chitosan displayed no cytotoxicity. However, each polymer also had a drawback: longer PEIs showed strong cytotoxicities, and chitosan had an inferior transport efficiency. The synthesized polyamides in this study had an abundance of secondary amines and hydroxy groups, and showed both good biocompatibilities and high transport efficiencies. Similar to PEI and chitosan, the synthesized polyamides formed viral-like electrostatic complexes with plasmid DNA (pDNA), termed polyplexes, which were taken up through the endocytotic pathway and dissociated within the endosome. The stereochemistry between the hexaric acid moiety and the number of amines in the repeating units greatly changed the binding affinity to pDNA, its volume in the binding complex, and its transportation efficiency into cells. The polymers derived from *meso*-galactaric acid showed higher transport efficiencies than those derived from [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid or [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acid.\n\n3.3. Macromolecules {#sec3dot3-ijms-20-03660}\n-------------------\n\nMacromolecules derived from hexaric acids have also been studied for use in drug delivery systems \\[[@B50-ijms-20-03660],[@B51-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Gu et al. synthesized amphiphilic macromolecules by bonding the hydroxy groups and a terminal carboxylic group of the hexaric acids, commencing with *meso*-galactaric acid, to alkyl chains and poly(ethylene glycol)s, respectively ([Figure 4](#ijms-20-03660-f004){ref-type=\"fig\"}) \\[[@B51-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nThe resulting amphiphilic macromolecules, which showed low critical micelle concentrations, were studied for use as drug carriers for hydrophobic anticancer agents and gene therapy agents. Furthermore, these amphiphilic macromolecules were found to treat atherosclerosis by preventing macrophage intake of oxidized low-density lipoproteins.\n\n3.4. Chelating Agents, Coordination Polymers and Metal--Organic Frameworks {#sec3dot4-ijms-20-03660}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComplexation of the carboxyl and hydroxy groups of hexaric acids with metals has been used in applied research. For example, such products have been investigated for use as agents to remove metals from polluted environments and incinerator plants, as corrosion inhibitors, and as Ca-sequestering agents, several of which have been commercialized \\[[@B6-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The chelation ability of hexaric acids was exploited for the synthesis of coordination polymers and metal--organic frameworks (MOFs). Abrahams et al. synthesized coordination polymers derived from hexaric acids and metals. For example, they used [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid and Zn to form a coordination polymer with two types of isolated, parallel channels, one of which was hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic \\[[@B44-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The hydroxy groups of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid were exposed in the hydrophilic channels, while the hydrophobic channels had C-H bonds along the channel wall. Water molecules were in both channels, especially in the hydrophilic channel where they were hydrogen bonded. The water molecules in the hydrophobic channels were easily exchanged for azobenzene, I~2~, elemental sulfur, hydrocarbons, CCl~4~ and CI~4~. This material was expected to be applicable to the simultaneous introduction of two different species into the different channels.\n\nWong et al. synthesized a porous structure from *meso*-galactaric acid and terbium that could detect guest molecules ([Figure 5](#ijms-20-03660-f005){ref-type=\"fig\"}) \\[[@B46-ijms-20-03660]\\]. This structure formed a two-dimensional networked complex that created vertical one-dimensional channels when stacked in layers. Crystallography of this MOF revealed that the layers were connected through hydrogen bonding via water molecules; however, heating removed the water molecules without destroying the structure. In aqueous solutions, this MOF could remove I^−^, Br^−^, Cl^−^, F^−^, CN^−^, and CO~3~^2−^ and small amounts of SO~4~^2−^ and PO~4~^3−^. These anions were assumed to be removed by forming hydrogen bonds with the *meso*-galactaric acid moieties. The fluorescent properties of terbium, a lanthanide element, were successfully utilized to monitor the intake of anions into the MOF. Desorption of the anions from the MOF was confirmed by placing the absorbed complexes in pure water.\n\n3.5. Other Platform Chemicals {#sec3dot5-ijms-20-03660}\n-----------------------------\n\nHexaric acids have also been studied for use as the starting materials for other platform chemicals \\[[@B54-ijms-20-03660],[@B55-ijms-20-03660],[@B56-ijms-20-03660],[@B57-ijms-20-03660],[@B58-ijms-20-03660],[@B59-ijms-20-03660],[@B60-ijms-20-03660],[@B61-ijms-20-03660],[@B62-ijms-20-03660]\\], including adipic acid \\[[@B59-ijms-20-03660],[@B60-ijms-20-03660],[@B61-ijms-20-03660],[@B62-ijms-20-03660]\\], furan dicarboxylic acid (an alternative to terephthalic acid) \\[[@B57-ijms-20-03660]\\], and pyrrole \\[[@B55-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nLi et al. reported the highly efficient conversion of *meso*-galactaric acid, via muconic acid, into adipic acid through an oxorhenium-complex-catalyzed deoxydehydration (DODH) reaction and following a Pt/C-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation \\[[@B59-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Ionic liquid was integrated as a reaction medium into this DODH reaction in another paper \\[[@B61-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The use of ionic liquid enabled an efficient separation of muconic acid by simple decantation. The recovered ionic liquid, which contained an expensive Re catalyst, was used up to four times without much of a decrease in yields. [d]{.smallcaps}-Glucaric acid can also be a starting compound for adipic acid. Recently, a catalyst system that provided adipate esters from [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid in a single operation was reported, in which hydrogen was used as a terminal reductant \\[[@B62-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nAccording to the report by Thiyagarajan et al. \\[[@B58-ijms-20-03660]\\], although the first report of furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid from *meso*-galactaric acid was published in 1876, little attention has been paid to this route because isolated yields were moderate and *meso*-galactaric acid was not readily available. In terms of the availability of hexaric acids including *meso*-galactaric acid, it will be improved by the research mentioned in following sections. As for synthesis of furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid from *meso*-galactaric acid, some works were reported. For example, one-step synthesis of dibutyl furandicarboxylates from *meso*-galactaric acid and 1-butanol, in the presence of sulfuric acid, was reported \\[[@B57-ijms-20-03660]\\]. In this paper, the diester of furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid was synthesized because it can be distilled or recrystallized by the use of existing solvents and can be polymerized directly using diols.\n\n4. Hexaric Acid Production Using Inorganic Catalysts {#sec4-ijms-20-03660}\n====================================================\n\nThe earliest attempts of hexaric acid preparation were reported in the late 1800s (oxidation of carbohydrates with HNO~3~, of which the reaction origin could be traced back to lactose oxidation by Liebig and is still used today \\[[@B65-ijms-20-03660],[@B66-ijms-20-03660]\\]). However, the yields using this method are limited to approximately 40% because of side reactions. Moreover, this method results in the excessive production of nitrogen oxide gas because of the rapid and highly exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction. These drawbacks have prevented the mass production of hexaric acids using this method \\[[@B67-ijms-20-03660],[@B68-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Kiely's group have improved [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric and [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acid production via nitric acid oxidation to solve these problems, enabling industrial mass production of these hexaric acids ([Figure 6](#ijms-20-03660-f006){ref-type=\"fig\"}) \\[[@B67-ijms-20-03660],[@B69-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nIn their studies, the amount, rate, and temperature of the [d]{.smallcaps}-glucose and [d]{.smallcaps}-mannose additions were controlled by a computer to prevent rapid temperature increases caused by the oxidation of the saccharides by nitric acid and the resulting generation of large amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other gases. Relatively low reaction temperatures (25--40 °C) were accomplished. Furthermore, a positive oxygen pressure on the reaction system generated nitric dioxide from nitric monoxide, and the dissolution of the dioxide into water reproduced nitric acid, enabling reproduction and recycling of the nitric acid ([Figure 7](#ijms-20-03660-f007){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The removal of nitric acid from the reaction mixture was also improved.\n\nTo date, nitric acid has been removed by evaporation by heating under reduced pressure. However, complete removal is difficult because nitric acid and water form a negative azeotrope. Moreover, the relatively severe conditions used in this method allow for further oxidation reactions to occur in an uncontrolled manner. Therefore, nitric acid removal by nanofiltration and diffusion dialysis was also investigated in Kiely's study. Selective nitric acid removal was achieved by both methods. However, because the addition of a large amount of water and pH adjustment was necessary, nanofiltration was not practical. Diffusion dialysis required neither the addition of water, the adjustment of pH, nor large amounts of energy for nitric acid removal. Further recycling of the removed nitric acid was easy. However, a problem remains in that the removed nitric acid solution contains a large amount of the products. Moreover, the yield of the reaction was not improved, remaining at 45% for [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid. In addition to nitric acid oxidation, the production of hexaric acids by oxidation with bromine and manganese(III) sulfate has been reported \\[[@B70-ijms-20-03660],[@B71-ijms-20-03660],[@B72-ijms-20-03660],[@B73-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Recently, ozonic oxidation has been proposed to solve several of the problems of conventional conversions, including their high environmental burden, byproduct generation, slow reaction rates, and high costs \\[[@B74-ijms-20-03660],[@B75-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nIn addition to the use of strong oxidants, catalytic oxidation with transition metals has been explored. The Pt-catalyzed production of a hexaric acid, [d]{.smallcaps}-mannaric acid, was reported in 1938 \\[[@B76-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Production of hexaric acids catalyzed by metals has been of industrial interest since the 1940s \\[[@B77-ijms-20-03660],[@B78-ijms-20-03660],[@B79-ijms-20-03660],[@B80-ijms-20-03660],[@B81-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Following these antecedent works, several studies have been reported \\[[@B68-ijms-20-03660],[@B82-ijms-20-03660],[@B83-ijms-20-03660],[@B84-ijms-20-03660],[@B85-ijms-20-03660],[@B86-ijms-20-03660],[@B87-ijms-20-03660],[@B88-ijms-20-03660],[@B89-ijms-20-03660],[@B90-ijms-20-03660],[@B91-ijms-20-03660],[@B92-ijms-20-03660],[@B93-ijms-20-03660],[@B94-ijms-20-03660],[@B95-ijms-20-03660],[@B96-ijms-20-03660],[@B97-ijms-20-03660],[@B98-ijms-20-03660]\\].

Aldohexoses \\[[@B84-ijms-20-03660],[@B85-ijms-20-03660],[@B86-ijms-20-03660],[@B87-ijms-20-03660],[@B88-ijms-20-03660],[@B90-ijms-20-03660],[@B91-ijms-20-03660],[@B92-ijms-20-03660],[@B93-ijms-20-03660],[@B94-ijms-20-03660],[@B95-ijms-20-03660],[@B97-ijms-20-03660],[@B98-ijms-20-03660]\\], aldohexonic acids \\[[@B82-ijms-20-03660],[@B83-ijms-20-03660],[@B84-ijms-20-03660]\\], and hexuronic acid \\[[@B68-ijms-20-03660],[@B89-ijms-20-03660],[@B96-ijms-20-03660]\\], in addition to the corresponding sugar alcohol \\[[@B76-ijms-20-03660],[@B85-ijms-20-03660]\\], can be starting compounds for the metal-catalyzed production of hexaric acids. In addition to the use of oxidants like H~2~O~2~ and O~2~, electrochemical \\[[@B85-ijms-20-03660],[@B90-ijms-20-03660]\\] and photochemical \\[[@B87-ijms-20-03660],[@B88-ijms-20-03660]\\] oxidation of the substrates has been examined. Recently, catalysis under autogenous pH conditions has attracted attention, although alkaline conditions were favored for some traditional efficient catalysis reactions \\[[@B95-ijms-20-03660],[@B96-ijms-20-03660],[@B97-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nHexaric acid separation from the reaction mixture was based on various methodologies, including precipitation by lowering the pH and the use of ion exchange resins \\[[@B67-ijms-20-03660],[@B69-ijms-20-03660],[@B100-ijms-20-03660]\\]. For example, [d]{.smallcaps}-glucarate was isolated by pH change (basification of the reaction mixture to pH 9.5, which was followed by acidification to pH 3--4 \\[[@B67-ijms-20-03660]\\]). *meso*-Galactarate was also separated from the culture supernatant by acid precipitation, where 97% recovery was achieved with 97.5% purity at pH 6.5 \\[[@B100-ijms-20-03660]\\]. [d]{.smallcaps}-Glucarate and [d]{.smallcaps}-mannarate were separated from each reaction mixture by ion exchange resins following their analyses \\[[@B67-ijms-20-03660],[@B69-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\n5. Hexaric Acid Production Using Biocatalysts {#sec5-ijms-20-03660}\n=============================================\n\nHexaric acid production using biocatalysts has also been studied. Biocatalysts, which are regenerable, enable environmentally friendly hexaric acid production. Furthermore, the substrate and reaction specificity of biocatalysts commonly omit the need for strict purification processes to extract the saccharides from the biomass \\[[@B6-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nAlthough a variety of dehydrogenases and oxidases are known to oxidize hexoses at the C1 position, few reports describe direct enzymatic oxidation of hexoses at the C6 position, such as eukaryotic and bacterial organisms that use uridine diphosphate (UDP)- and guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound hexoses as substrates to oxidize the C6 position. The products of these reactions are UDP- and GDP-uronic acids, which serve as the starting compounds for synthesizing polysaccharides, ascorbic acid, and other biomolecules \\[[@B6-ijms-20-03660],[@B101-ijms-20-03660],[@B102-ijms-20-03660],[@B103-ijms-20-03660],[@B104-ijms-20-03660],[@B105-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nBecause direct oxidation of hexose at the C6 position is difficult, combinations of biocatalysts have been used to produce hexuronic acids. For instance, Moon et al. reported a method for the production of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid using genetically modified *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli,* [Figure 8](#ijms-20-03660-f008){ref-type=\"fig\"}) \\[[@B106-ijms-20-03660]\\]. In recombinant *E.* *coli*, phosphotransferase activity produces [d]{.smallcaps}-glucose-6-phosphate, which is then converted by *myo*-inositol-1-phosphate synthase into *myo*-inositol-1-phosphate. A phosphatase then converts the *myo*-inositol-1-phosphate into *myo*-inositol, which is then converted to [d]{.smallcaps}-glucuronic acid (the hexuronic acid of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucose) by *myo*-inositol oxidase. Moon's report also describes the production of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucaric acid from the oxidation of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucuronic acid by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent uronate dehydrogenase (UDH). Because the yield of this reaction was low, improvements in the production system have been made \\[[@B107-ijms-20-03660],[@B108-ijms-20-03660],[@B109-ijms-20-03660],[@B110-ijms-20-03660],[@B111-ijms-20-03660],[@B112-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Galactose oxidase is an uncommon enzyme that can oxidize hexoses at the C6 position. For example, [d]{.smallcaps}-galactose oxidation catalyzed by this enzyme produces [d]{.smallcaps}-galactohexodialdose \\[[@B113-ijms-20-03660],[@B114-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The enzymatic oxidation of [d]{.smallcaps}-galactohexodialdose cannot produce hexuronic acid or hexaric acid because bicyclic structures are formed; however, the oxidation of dialdose by sodium chlorite is reported to produce [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid, the hexuronic acid of [d]{.smallcaps}-galactose \\[[@B115-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Recently, a mutation in this enzyme, changing its structure, was reported to enable glucose oxidation at the C6 position \\[[@B107-ijms-20-03660],[@B116-ijms-20-03660],[@B117-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nAs described above, UDP- and GDP-uronic acids have been utilized to synthesize polysaccharides in vivo; thus, hexuronic acids are abundant in nature as the main component of polysaccharides \\[[@B6-ijms-20-03660],[@B101-ijms-20-03660],[@B102-ijms-20-03660],[@B103-ijms-20-03660],[@B104-ijms-20-03660],[@B105-ijms-20-03660]\\]. For example, [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid can be derived from pectin \\[[@B118-ijms-20-03660],[@B119-ijms-20-03660],[@B120-ijms-20-03660],[@B121-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Alginic acid hydrolysis produces [d]{.smallcaps}-mannuronic acid and [l]{.smallcaps}-guluronic acid, the hexuronic acids of [d]{.smallcaps}-mannose and [l]{.smallcaps}-gulose, respectively \\[[@B122-ijms-20-03660],[@B123-ijms-20-03660],[@B124-ijms-20-03660],[@B125-ijms-20-03660],[@B126-ijms-20-03660],[@B127-ijms-20-03660]\\]. [d]{.smallcaps}-Glucuronic acid can be obtained from hemicellulose \\[[@B128-ijms-20-03660],[@B129-ijms-20-03660]\\]. [d]{.smallcaps}-Glucuronic acid can also be obtained as a monomer from ulvan \\[[@B123-ijms-20-03660],[@B130-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Therefore, some studies have used hexuronic acids derived from polysaccharides, which are not used as food, as the starting compounds for hexaric acids.\n\nMojzita et al. reported the production of *meso*-galactaric acid from [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid using recombinant microorganisms in which the gene for UDH had been introduced \\[[@B100-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Many microorganisms that live on putrid plants have enzymatic pathways that catabolize [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid. Eukaryotic microorganisms use a reduction pathway that starts with the reduction of [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid into [l]{.smallcaps}-galactonic acid, catalyzed by [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid reductase, while bacteria use an oxidative pathway that first produces *meso*-galactaric acid in a reaction catalyzed by UDH. In their study, Mojzita et al. eliminated the gene for [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid reductase in two eukaryotic microorganisms, *Aspergillus niger* (*A. niger*) and *Hypocrea jecorina* (*H. jecorina*), and introduced the gene for UDH, which was derived from the bacterium *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* (*A. tumefaciens*). Neither strain with a single-gene deletion of the reductase grew on medium in which [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid was the sole carbon source. In contrast, *meso*-galactaric acid production in both strains was confirmed when deletion of the reductase was accompanied by introduction of the dehydrogenase ([Figure 9](#ijms-20-03660-f009){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Because the amount of *meso*-galactaric acid obtained was small in the case of *A. niger*, it is assumed that *A. niger* metabolizes *meso*-galactaric acid derived from [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid. Although a high yield of *meso*-galactaric acid was achieved with *H. jecorina*, the addition of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucose as an energy source was necessary because [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid cannot be used as the sole carbon source. Furthermore, the addition of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucose was found to decrease the yield of *meso*-galactaric acid. The fermentation method used to produce *meso*-galactaric acid has been improved \\[[@B131-ijms-20-03660],[@B132-ijms-20-03660],[@B133-ijms-20-03660],[@B134-ijms-20-03660],[@B135-ijms-20-03660],[@B136-ijms-20-03660]\\].\n\nWhen chemicals are produced through an oxidative reaction, the electrons obtained from the substrate are usually transferred to electron accepters, such as O~2~. However, an enzymatic anode in a biofuel cell can serve as an electron acceptor. Enzymatic oxidative conversion on the anode can be combined with O~2~ reduction on the cathode to generate electricity. That is, the simultaneous production of chemicals and electricity is possible through oxidative conversion within enzymatic biofuel cells. This method reduces the energy required for producing chemicals and can even generate energy for other uses. The concept of a system that co-produces platform chemicals and electrical energy from biomass by demonstrating the simultaneous production of a hexaric acid and electrical energy using an enzymatic biofuel cell has been proposed \\[[@B137-ijms-20-03660],[@B138-ijms-20-03660],[@B139-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The electrochemical oxidation of [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid and the production of *meso*-galactaric acid by a pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH)-modified electrode was confirmed \\[[@B137-ijms-20-03660],[@B139-ijms-20-03660]\\]. The electrode was used as the anode in a biofuel cell with a bilirubin oxidase (BOD) cathode \\[[@B139-ijms-20-03660]\\] ([Figure 10](#ijms-20-03660-f010){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The cell generated electricity by using [d]{.smallcaps}-galacturonic acid and the hydrolysate of pectic acid as a fuel. This simultaneous production mechanism is applicable to other chemicals. We confirmed the oxidation of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucuronate and [d]{.smallcaps}-mannuronate, both catalyzed by PQQ-GDH, and the oxidation of [l]{.smallcaps}-guluronate, catalyzed by the PQQ domain of pyranose dehydrogenase from *Coprinopsis cinerea* (DH~PDH~) \\[[@B138-ijms-20-03660],[@B139-ijms-20-03660]\\]. According to NMR measurements, the production of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucarate from the oxidation of [d]{.smallcaps}-glucuronate and [l]{.smallcaps}-guluronate and the production of [d]{.smallcaps}-mannarate from the [d]{.smallcaps}-mannuronate oxidation were confirmed. DH~PDH~ is also suitable for use as an anode catalyst. These combinations of enzymes and chemicals are applicable to simultaneous production systems.\n\n6. Conclusions {#sec6-ijms-20-03660}\n==============\n\nHexaric acids are sugar acids that can be produced from biomass. Due to their stereochemical diversity, chelation abilities, and high solubility in water, numerous applications have been developed. These applications include their use as chelating agents and corrosion inhibitors and as precursors for various polymers, coordination polymers, macromolecules, cross-linkers in hydrogels, and medicines. The conventional production of hexaric acids is conducted by the oxidation of saccharides with nitric acids. To overcome the problems derived from the use of nitric acids, in addition to improving the nitric acid oxidation process, green chemical methods have been developed to produce hexaric acids. Transition metal catalysts and modified microorganisms have been utilized to produce hexaric acids from hexuronic acids under mild conditions. Quite recently, the production of hexuronic acids using high-frequency ultrasound irradiation without a catalyst has been reported \\[[@B140-ijms-20-03660]\\]. In addition, the production of hexuronic acids by using metal catalysts has been developed \\[[@B141-ijms-20-03660]\\]. Combining these technologies with the aforementioned technologies, the production of hexaric acids can be improved. Furthermore, hexaric acid was produced directly from aldohexoses by using modified microorganisms.

        "text": "Student-athletes are more comfortable approaching informal sources of help rather than professional mental health practitioners. Informal sources such as parents, close friends, and siblings are their primary preferred helpers. The least likely to be approached for help are professional help-givers like faculty, religious members, and counselors.\n\nThe barriers to help-seeking for student-athletes are more internal (e.g., win-at-all- cost philosophy, time management, social stigma, debasing potential concerns, lack of transportation to the counseling venue) than external (e.g., barriers created by the athletic department and the University).\n\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nThis study explored the help-seeking behavior of male college basketball players, the context in which it takes place, the process involved in seeking help, the specific barriers to help-seeking and the possible intervention that would facilitate help-seeking. Specifically, this study answered the following questions:\n\nWhat is the context in which help-seeking behavior occurs among male college basketball players? (Concept of help-seeking; Typical problems; Frequency of seeking help; Preferred helpers and their qualities; and Venue for help-seeking)\n\nWhat is the process involved in seeking help?\n\nWhat are the barriers to seeking help? (Internal and External barriers)\n\nBased on the responses, what intervention can be introduced to facilitate help-seeking behavior among student-athletes?\n\nWhat is the result of the pilot run of the intervention to promote help-seeking behavior? (Barriers to help-seeking before and after; Feedback of participants)\n\nTHEORY\n\nThis study looked into the help-seeking behavior of male basketball players from different colleges and universities in Metro Manila. Specifically, it looked into the context, process, barriers, and interventions in help-seeking behavior.\n\nIt was guided by the help- seeking model originally proposed by Srebnik, Cauce, and Baydar (1996). For the purpose of this study, modifications were introduced to include context, barriers, and interventions.\n\nHelp-Seeking Behavior\n\nCauce et al. (2002) defined help-seeking as a process that “is most likely to occur when a mental health problem is recognized as undesirable and when it is deemed not apt to go way on its own.”\n\nIt is a three-stage interchangeable process, which involves problem recognition, the decision to seek help, and the selection of the help provider, since each step in this model can be influenced by culture and context.\n\nThe help-seeking pathways model of Srebnik, Cauce, and Baydar (1996) was inspired by the earlier work of Anderson and Newman (1973), Goldsmith, Jackson, and Hough (1988), and Pescosolido (1992).\n\nCauce et al. (2002) believed that the key to understanding the needs of a client should start at the onset of the help-seeking process.\n\nContext\n\nDefined as the background stimuli that accompany some kind of foreground event. In this study, it pertains to the concept of help-seeking among the student-athletes; their problems, which prompt them to seek help; preferred helpers and qualities; frequency of seeking help; and venue for seeking help.\n\nProcess\n\nProcess is operationally defined in this study as the procedure involved in seeking help. The three-stage interchangeable process proposed by Cauce et al. (2002) was used in this study.\n\nBarriers in Help-Seeking Behavior\n\nThe working definition and description of barriers were adapted from Mansfield et al. (2005) for this study. The authors described barriers as “the variables, which are identified as obstacles to seeking help for physical or mental health problems.” In this study, barriers were classified into two categories: internal and external.\n\nIntervention\n\nDescribes the proposed program that will facilitate help-seeking behavior for either the student-athlete or preferred helper based on the study’s findings.\n\nRESULTS\n\nConcept of Help Seeking Behavior\n\nDefinition: “Seeking help for a problem that cannot be individually solved.” (N = 58; 53%)\n\n3 of the 5 factors received mean ratings of 2 plus which means that they are fairly important reasons not to seek help.\n\nFactor 4: Privacy, with a mean score of 2.115, was seen as the primary barrier, Factor 2: Minimizing Problem and Resignation (2.086), and Factor 1: Need for Control and Self-Reliance (2.012).\n\nSuggestions to Encourage Student-Athletes to Seek Help\n\nEncourage them not to be too proud, shy, or scared in approaching others (33%/16%)\n\nGive advice and encouragement (20%/11%)\n\nHave a program on communicating/counseling athletes (0%/21%).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nProcess: Help-Seeking Behavior\n\nCauce, et al. (2002) defined help-seeking as a process that “is most likely to occur when a mental health problem is recognized as undesirable and when it is deemed not apt to go way on its own.”\n\nIt is a three-stage interchangeable process, which involves problem recognition (PR), the decision to seek help (DTSH), and the selection of the help provider (SS) as each step in this model can be influenced by culture and context.\n\nThe authors developed items based on literature in the areas of gender-role strain and gender-role conflict. Based on these findings, an inventory of potential barriers to help-seeking was constructed to identify the “reason a person might choose not to seek help for a problem.”\n\nUNIQUE CONTRIBUTION\n\nWorking Definition\n\nConcept of help-seeking; Typical problems; Frequency of seeking help; Preferred helpers and their qualities; and Venue for help-seeking.\n\nProgram Manual\n\nProgram was designed to enhance help-seeking behavior and practices among collegiate basketball student-athletes who participate in the UAAP and NCAA tournaments.\n\nProgram focuses on reducing deterrent help-seeking behavior through the use of psychoeducation and role induction (anticipatory socialization).\n\nReduce inhibitions by providing the student-athletes with knowledge of the subject, communication skills, and time management strategies."

        "text": "PORTLAND — Florida coach Mike White was huddling with his father, Duke athletic director Kevin White, in a Moda Center hallway on Sunday night when Mike Krzyzewski walked by. Krzyzewski stopped, put an arm around his coaching counterpart and leaned in toward White’s ear. “Don’t change a (bleeping) thing,” Krzyzewski said. “You guys are great. We were lucky.”\n\nWords like that from the all-time wins leader in men’s college basketball history had to be encouraging. But they could not erase the sting for White and his Gators, who let a golden opportunity slip by in an 87-84 loss to Krzyzewski’s Blue Devils in the PK80 Motion Bracket final. Florida squandered a 17-point second-half lead and a chance to beat the top-ranked team in the regular season for the first time in school history, a result that would have resonated all the way to Selection Sunday.\n\nThe consolation prize came in what the Gators gained during this tournament: respect and most likely more fans, at least among the Left Coasters, insomniacs and straight-up basketball junkies who stayed awake to watch their late-night tips. They played fast and fearless, spreading the floor with four guys who could shoot, penetrate and punch above their weight. They proved they’re an elite team that belongs in any discussion of national title contenders with one of the most devastating offensive attacks around. Right up until it sputtered to an untimely halt.\n\nDuke had rallied from 16 points down to beat Texas in overtime on Friday, but Florida – with its veteran guards and relentless scoring ability — didn’t seem likely to fall prey to a similar comeback. However, a team that hit 32 3-pointers in its first two PK80 games and was connecting on 47 percent from behind the arc coming into the game would make only one shot from distance in the second half. Two uncharacteristic turnovers in the final 1:15 led to Duke free throws. Jalen Hudson, an 81 percent free-throw shooter, missed the front end of a key one-and-one. The Gators failed to score in the final 2:38.\n\nWhite’s players clearly lacked something down the stretch, less than 48 hours after a 111-105 double-overtime win over Gonzaga. Point guard Chris Chiozza, who logged 46 minutes in that game and was dealing with an assortment of minor injuries including a bruised rib, admitted that he and his teammates had emptied the tank. “We tried the best we could to get a lot of rest (on Saturday),” Chiozza said. “You could tell in the second half we didn’t have enough gas to finish it off. We missed shots we normally make, probably because we didn’t have any legs left.”\n\nWhite didn’t like hearing Chiozza’s comments, because he didn’t want to make any excuses. He pointed out that Duke played an overtime game on Friday as well, though it came several hours earlier in the day. Yet he wondered aloud if his team would have been better served by walking the ball up and milking the shot clock more when it had the big lead in the second half.\n\nThat’s not the way his guys play, however. They attack. A perfect example of that came earlier in the half. Two Gators got tangled up going for a defensive rebound and hadn’t crossed halfcourt when Hudson launched from two feet inside the 3-point line. For most teams except maybe Alabama, that three-against-five long jumper was the textbook example of a bad shot. It went in.\n\n“That’s what we do,” White said. “I want to stay aggressive and play the way we play.”\n\nWhen things are clicking, that style can be devastating. Chiozza is one of the smartest distributors in the country, and closing out on shooters like Hudson and KeVaughn Allen only opens the lane for penetration. Florida scored 1.37 points per possession on Thursday night versus Stanford, 1.23 against Gonzaga and was on pace for that kind of number against Duke before the late lull.\n\nThere’s also a downside to starting four guards and the 6-foot-8 Keith Stone, and it rears its head down low. Gonzaga big man Johnathan Williams burned the Gators for 39 points and 12 rebounds on Friday. Then came Marvin Bagley III on Sunday. Florida simply had no answer for the sensational freshman, who finished with 30 points and 15 rebounds. In the second half, White used 6-foot-5 guard Egor Koulechov as the primary defender against Bagley. It’s safe to say that Koulechov never faced that kind of defensive assignment while playing the last two years at Rice.\n\nSome inside help could arrive in January, when 6-foot-11 senior John Egbunu is expected back from a torn ACL. But teams like Texas A&M and Kentucky will pose the same kind of length problems in the SEC.\n\n“It’s a big concern for us,” White said. “We’ve got to figure something out. Whether it’s man-to-man or if we need to be more creative, we’ve got to figure some stuff out.”\n\nOne way to counter the lack of size is simply to outshoot the opponent, to trade 3s for their 2s. It eventually worked against Gonzaga and nearly did versus Duke, which switched between zone and man-to-man defenses in an attempt to disrupt Florida’s spacing and shooting. With apologies to Steve Spurrier, these are the new Fun-N-Gun Gators. But being so perimeter-oriented can also create lots of runs. They went through dry spells in the Gonzaga game and turned a 14-point first-half advantage on Sunday into a seven-point deficit before storming back to lead again at halftime.\n\nThat’s a dizzying way to live, but when Florida’s guys were going full steam early against Duke, they were swarming passing lanes and crashing the glass in waves.\n\n“We just showed that we’ve got some toughness in us,” said Chiozza, who all but waddled into the postgame news conference on his drained legs. “That was the question coming into this tournament. I think we showed that we’re one of the toughest teams in the country.”\n\nKrzyzewski seemed to agree. He told reporters that Florida is “as good a team as we’ll play, I think.” There are plenty of reasons for the Gators to be encouraged by what happened in Portland, even if White would still like to change a few things.\n\n(Top photo: Brian Murphy/Associated Press)"
